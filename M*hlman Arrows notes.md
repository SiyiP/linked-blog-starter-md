do NOT go by specific HLAs. 

w/ aldosterone= it's specifically based on blood pressure and RAAS and based on the detection of LOW Na in the blood 
- note that it upreg Na/K ATPase pump on the CD... inc **NA resorption and K+ secretion, and water follows Na.**
- there's also a **H-ATPase pump... kicking protons out into the urine and keeping more bicarb in.** we end up blowing off CO2 to compensate. 

recall - AT1 is cleaved into AT2 in the **lungs**

spironolactone 
- inc Renin, AT1, AT2, aldosterone AND K+ 
- as an **aldosterone receptor antagonist, blocking Aldosterone receptor causes all to inc**
- a potassium sparing diuretic, bc aldosterone causes K+ secretion from blood to the urine. 

enapril = *an ACEi*
- recall that AT2 is a **vasoconstrictor!!! inc aldosterone synthase activity AND constricts peripheral arterioles**
- ACEi = will **decrease afterload of LV by releaving constrictive of AT2 on peripheral arterioles.**
- afferent diameter is not changed bc AT2 only acts on the efferent diameters. 


hyperpigmentation of forearms + eosinophilia + fatigue + 100/60 = **addisons dz**
- addison's disease or hypoadrenalism = seen with autoantibodies against **21-hydroxylase of adrenal cortex**
- so dec ald and cortisol... 
- decreased cortisol = > no neg feedback at hypothalamus -> ACTH and CRH... 
- **eosinophilia is common in adrenal insufficiency!!!!!!!!** cortisol can sequester eosinophils in the spleen. 

note - if someone got a lot of prednisone and steroids, and had a cushingoid apperaance what's their ACTH and cortisol lvls?
- ACTH down, cortisol DOWN 
- so prednisone isn't cortisol but STILL induce neg feedback , reducing ACTH. 

waterhouse-friderichsen - can be due to meningococcal septicmia. 

cortisol upregulates alpha1 on arterioles , catecholamines

chronically high glucocorticoid levels can cause K+ wasting at the distal kidney similar to aldosterone. 

sheehan syndrome = **pituitary getting too big physiologically during pregnancy to make prolactin -> ishcemic infarction -> decrease prod of pituitary hormones**
- **secondary hypothyroidism** bc TSH is low... decreased production of this 
- classically low prolactin 
- 
- ACTH which is also from pituitary gland is down. 
- aldosterone has to be up since the pituitary gland's ACTH is down. 
- ACTH -> cortisol inc -> upreg alpha1 receptors on systemic arterioles -> inc BP.... 
	- **without this effect, BP is lower, so impetus for aldosterone to increase.**

recent weight gain + pituitary mass + **point tenderness + fracture + muscle weak = osteoporosis!!!**
cushing disease can present as osteoporosis and weight gain in a pt with pituitary adenoma.... 
- K+ can be decreased bc of the glucocorticoids in kidney sometimes acting as mineralocorticoids when they are in high amounts 
- fludrocortisone = treat addisons = glucocorticoids with high mineralocorticoid effect.... 
- ACTH = up due to cushing dz 

ADH = aquaporin insertion into CD. = **free watr resorption, making urine more concentrated**
**urinary specific gravity = another way of measuring concentration/diluteness of urine**!!!! up if it's concentrated down if it's dilute 

smoking + recent weight loss + confusion = **SIADH secondary to small cell brochogenic carcinoma**


small cell lung cancer paraneoplastic syndromes 
  SIADH = adh secretion 
- Cushing with ACTH 
- lambert-eaton syndrome
- neurologic/cerebellar dysfunction with anti-hu/yo antibodies

squamous cell lung cancer paraneoplasticI hypercalcemia with PTHrp!!! 
- smoking + weight loss + kidney stone + coin lesion cxr 

blood in urine + L flank pain + weight loss + headaches + blur vision + heterogenous mass in L kidney 
- **renal cell carcinoma**
- secretion of PTHrp -> high ca low phosphate and pth down.... 
- **note - this can also secrete EPO -> secondary polycythemia hyperviscosity syndrome with headache, blurry vision, raynaud phenomenon.**

with psychogenic polydipsia, ADH will be LOW to allow for water micturition.... but serum sodium will be low bc the ADH is appropriately low. 


lithium causes nephrogenic diabetes insipitus!!! 
- PCT = always isotonic 
- JGA = always hypotonic bc it bridges the early DCT with afferent arterioles , so at the top of the thick ascending limb... meaning **after the masive ion reabsorption due to na/k/2cl symporters = dilute.**
- MCD/collecting duct = hypotonic in DI and psychogenic polydipsia 
- MCD = hypeertonic in siadh and dehydration 

and lithium also causes drug-induced thyroiditis!!!! 
- ADH is high and not low bc the hypothalamus and posterior pituitary function just fine so hypothalamus makes more ADH to compensate for **lack of receptor sensitivity at the kidney bc it's nephrogenic!!!**

NSAIDs long term causes analgesic nephropathy which will cause renal dz = nephrogenic DI 

secondary hyperthyroidism = a TRH or TSH secreting tumor. 
primary hyperthyroidism. - graves dz ofc, toxic adenoma and toxic multindular goiter or transient thyroiditis (postpartum, dequervain, drug induced.)

"patchy uptake of iodine" = hashimotos - diffuse decrease of uptake. 
- increased menstrual irregularities, hepatic transaminitis, dyslipidmia, and myopathy 

in dequervain thyroiditis = **viral infection followed by painful and tender thyroid**
- spacing bt thyroid gland cells inc = release of preformed T3/4 into the blood.... not overproduction of it. 
- uptake always decreased even if patient is hyperthyoid in subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. 
- note that this can be **hyperthyroid or hypothyroid.**

medullary thyroid carcinoma = sr calcitonin elevated, and mostly euthyroid, but can be hypothyroid. 

Can T3 be converted to T4.? no! 

subclinical hypothyroidism 
- T3 and 4 not symptomatic yet so no change, but elevated TSH 

recovering in hospital from ARDs 2ndary to pancreatitis .... 
- euthyroid sick syndrome - TSH and T4 normal 
- T3 down and rT3 up... bc the T4 is not detectable in excess so it's converted to an inactive form of T3. T4 still in normal range 

TBG mops up free T4 

with TBG being low then the total T4 lower bc = total T4 = bound T4 and free t4. 


alcoholics susceptible to hypomagnesemia bc of dietary deficiency!!!!
- low mg -> hypocalcemia and hypokalemia **bc basal levels of mg is required for proper pth gland functioning!!!**
so low ca, high po4, low pth and low mg with alcoholism 

B cells in digeorge syndrome is not impacted as much!!!!
- recall hypocalcemia, po4 up, pth down and **t cells down bc of thymic shadow absence**
- now if you had both thymic shadow down AND scant lymph nodes (B cell deficiiency) it would be SCID
- if just the scant lymph nodes/tonsils -> bruton agammaglobulinemia 

long standing htn type 2 and large BUN and creatinine = renal failure 
- **secondary hyper pth usually due to renal faliure**
- ca low bc it can't aborb in the late DCT 
- kidney can't make vitamin D3 so serum ca is also lower. 
and low sr ca -> pth go up.... phosphate is high in renal failure bc in spite of the high pth, the kidneys not able to downregulat the pct phosphate transporters, too much phosphate reabsorption 
- so secondary hypterparathyroidism is opposite ca and po4- arrows than the primary 


in ATN 
- high anion gap metabolic acidosis bc **reduced abililty to reabsorb bicarb in PCT and later secrete protons in CD**
- Na - (Cl+Hco3)
- mudpiles and co2 is acidic and blown offf to compensate 


chronic renal failure 
- K+ up in renal failure bc impaired distal renal secretion (normally done via aldosterone)
- po4 up in serum bc phosphate absorption in the pct can't be impaired.... normally pth will downreg pct phosphate reabsorption transporters 

pth adenoma - 
- pth high, so ca high and the urinary ca is high 
- **cAMP high in urine bc pth acts thru Gs proteins where adenyl cyclase activity and cAMP is increased**

familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia 
- decreased but not absent sensitivity of CSRs at parathyroid glands and kidneys = higher setpt of ca in blood , s mostly asymptomatic 
- urine will have lower ca and ca will be higher in serum since reabsorbing more 

pseudohypoparathyroidism = defective pth receptor!!!
- type 1 = albright hereditary osteodystrophy phenotype 
- shortened 4+5 metacarpals, round face, bony abnormalities and osteoma cutis - nodules of boney stuff. 
- no response to exogenous pth ofc 
- low sr ca, high phosphate high serum pth levels. 
- low urinary ca too 

tertiary hyperpth 
- renal failure = secondary where ca low, phos high and pth is high bc of failure of reabsorbing ca, and decreased syn of vitamin d and failure to downregulate pct reabsorption pumps keeping po4 high. pth high bc ca is low. 
- tertiary = **hyperplasia of the pth glands in pts with long standing secondary hyperparathyroidism!!!**
	- autonomous scretion of pth at higher basal levels, resetting ca level homeostasis to a high level 
	- and po4 is always high in **renal failure bc we can't have kidney downreg pct reabsorption pumps!**


done mehlmans 60-100 rn , will do rest soon. 
in squamous cell carcinoma - kidney stone + coin lesion , Sr Ca up, PO4 doown and PTH down as well 
- pth down bc it makes PTHrp instead 

renal cell carcinoma 
- heterogenous kidney mass, L flank pain and weight loss. urine has red 
- pth down bc we secrete pthrp 
- also! know that it makes EPO too which raises hb

bowing tibias = think rickets immediately, 
- low Ca bc no vitamin d, low po4, and pth is way up 

in osteoporosis all labs are normal , osteoblasts are down and osteoclasts are up with RANKL, stimulated by IL-6 and IL-1 and inhibited by estrogen 

pagets just have up ALP which reflects high osteoblast actiivty 

multiple myeloma - lytic lesions of the bone, suppression of pth due to calcium receptor action and ca up, and ESR up 
- renal(nephrotic renal syndrome) and cardiac Amyloidosis(restrictive) is common 

sarcoidosis has high vitamin D!!!
- meaning more absorbtion of ca, more PO4- and less PTH 
- because of their **granulomatous disease of non-caseating granulomas!!! in the center there's activated macrophages aka epithelioid macrophages which secrete plenty of 1-alphahydroxylase of the LUNGS, which converts inactive 25-D3 into active 1,25-D3**
- note that the kidney 1-alpha hydroxylase activity will go down
- in the same disease, fecal ca goes down since again absorption of ca is going up, 24,25 OH2 D3 is down and active form 1,25-D3 is up 

parathyroid adenomas -> secretion of a lot of PTH 
- osteoblast up, clasts up too and RANKL up too bc of 
- both blasts and clasts go up bc they need each other to activate, and RANKL is a ligand in blasts 
- Fecal Ca down bc PTH activates 1,25D3 to absorb more Ca too 

cystic fibrosis 
- steatorrhea -> low vitamin D bc not aborbing it 
- bone osteoid is down, hydroxyapatite is down, sr Ca down, sr PO4 down and PTH down 
- note we need vitamin D to convert unmineralized osteoid into hydroxyapatite, which is by definition mineralized!!!

chronic alcoholic who still eats a lot o fish and milk and works outside (plenty of vitamin D synthesis beginning)
- alcoholism stops the making of active vitamin D by stopping it before it gets that 25 added by the **liver step**!!! so you get more cholecalciferol but you won't have 25-OH nor 1,25-D3.... but renal hydroxylase up and liver hydroxylase down 

never in sun, lots of fish - we get plenty of 7-dehydrocholesterol but not any cholecaciferol which is made from UV. 

in menopause
- low E, low inhibin B and high LH and high FSH 
- ovaries decrease E production and inhibin B -> no negative feedback at hypothalamus, so high FSH and LH 

turners syndrome 
- E and inhibin B low bc streak ovaries, LH and FSH up 

klinefelters syndrome 
- testicular dysgenesis so less T , less negative feedback at the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary so more GnRH therefore more LH and FSH which increases E bc there's overexpression of aromatase (CYP19) in the testes 

pcos 
- abnormal GnRH pulsation!!!! increased LH compared to FSH 
- LH -> theca interna making androgens 
- FSH -> make it into E , but if its low follicular develoopment is insufficient by the time of LH peak, no ovulation! = no progesterone 

male genitals only develop if DHT is present which is made from 5-alpha-reductase. 
- the thing about this is that the patient will get a huge surge of hormones at puberty with high T , and male genitals or phallus development. 

prolactinoma male 30 , prolactin goes up , GnRH down and E down - recall that **prolactin supresses hypothalamus GnRH pulses**

severed pituitary stalk means everything from the pituitary goes down except for prolactin 

trisomy 21 - pappa down, beta HCG up, and nuchal translucency up at 9 wks gestation 
in 17 wks gestation, AFP down, b-hcg still up, estriol down, inhibin A up 

in laxative weight loss, K goes down, and bicarb down too bc stool contains these too! 
- anion gap is regular 

in cases of loop diuretic abuse, K goes down, Cl up and HCO3 goes up and pH is up, and co2 is up 
- loop diuretics mean the thick ascending limb is inhibiting Cl and K and Na absorption 
- so RAAS up with volume loss, meaning more H+ will be secreted, and we get metabolic alkalosis 
- these are the same with contraction alkalosis wiht vomitting too! same arrows. 

spiro abuse - aldosterone receptor inhibitor 
- K+ up, HCO3 down, pH down, CO2 down, and androgen receptor down 
- basically we will be losing the ENACs, so we cant expel K+ nor can we take in bicarb anymore, and co2 will be down in response to that. 
- Normal anion-gap metabolic acidosis occurs because aldosterone’s ability to activate the secretory apical H+-ATPase is blocked.

hydrocholorothiazide abuse 
- serum calcium is up and K+ is down and HCO3 is up and pH up .... 
- with thiazides Na-Cl symporter is inhibited in the early, making it so that Ca reabsorption is more likely in the Distal DCT 
- Volume depletion caused by thiazides leads to RAAS upregulation and distal secretion of protons and potassium in the cortical collecting duct.

In situations where perfusion to the kidney is acutely decreased (i.e., blood loss or ventricular fibrillation), the answer is acute tubular necrosis, not prerenal. 
This is because the PCT has the highest oxygen demand in the kidney due to the high concentrations of ATPase pumps, so it is most susceptible to an abrupt drop in oxygenation/perfusion.

Prerenal is the answer for more subacute or chronic etiologies of reduced renal perfusion, such as diuretic use, dehydration, left heart failure, and NSAIDs. These etiologies take days to months to cause prerenal azotemia. In contrast, exsanguination or ventricular fibrillation will cause an abrupt and fast drop in perfusion.

adrenal enzyme deficiencies of sex disorders / hyroxylases. 
ending in 1 = 17-OH substrates increase, DHEA (male and female hormone precursor) increase, and androstenedione (another precursor) increase, so we get virilization 

21-hydroxylase specific
- cortisone and aldosterone is low 
- K+ is high, Na low, pH is low , HO3- is low, glucose is low, and BP is average 
- we see virilization 

11-hydroxylase specific=
- Sr K either low or normal, Na, pH and HCO3-, glucose all either high or normal 
- BP is high bc the precursors are high so there's some mineralocorticoid effects. 
- cortisol and aldosterone are low 

17-hydroxylase def
- low 17-OH substrates, low DHEA/androstenedione 
- low K, high Na, high pH , high HCO3-, high BP because of high aldosterone. 
- low glucose bc of low cortisol
