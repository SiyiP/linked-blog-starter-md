do NOT go by specific HLAs. 

w/ aldosterone= it's specifically based on blood pressure and RAAS and based on the detection of LOW Na in the blood 
- note that it upreg Na/K ATPase pump on the CD... inc **NA resorption and K+ secretion, and water follows Na.**
- there's also a **H-ATPase pump... kicking protons out into the urine and keeping more bicarb in.** we end up blowing off CO2 to compensate. 

recall - AT1 is cleaved into AT2 in the **lungs**

spironolactone 
- inc Renin, AT1, AT2, aldosterone AND K+ 
- as an **aldosterone receptor antagonist, blocking Aldosterone receptor causes all to inc**
- a potassium sparing diuretic, bc aldosterone causes K+ secretion from blood to the urine. 

enapril = *an ACEi*
- recall that AT2 is a **vasoconstrictor!!! inc aldosterone synthase activity AND constricts peripheral arterioles**
- ACEi = will **decrease afterload of LV by releaving constrictive of AT2 on peripheral arterioles.**
- afferent diameter is not changed bc AT2 only acts on the efferent diameters. 


hyperpigmentation of forearms + eosinophilia + fatigue + 100/60 = **addisons dz**
- addison's disease or hypoadrenalism = seen with autoantibodies against **21-hydroxylase of adrenal cortex**
- so dec ald and cortisol... 
- decreased cortisol = > no neg feedback at hypothalamus -> ACTH and CRH... 
- **eosinophilia is common in adrenal insufficiency!!!!!!!!** cortisol can sequester eosinophils in the spleen. 

note - if someone got a lot of prednisone and steroids, and had a cushingoid apperaance what's their ACTH and cortisol lvls?
- ACTH down, cortisol DOWN 
- so prednisone isn't cortisol but STILL induce neg feedback , reducing ACTH. 

waterhouse-friderichsen - can be due to meningococcal septicmia. 

cortisol upregulates alpha1 on arterioles , catecholamines

chronically high glucocorticoid levels can cause K+ wasting at the distal kidney similar to aldosterone. 

sheehan syndrome = **pituitary getting too big physiologically during pregnancy to make prolactin -> ishcemic infarction -> decrease prod of pituitary hormones**
- **secondary hypothyroidism** bc TSH is low... decreased production of this 
- classically low prolactin 
- 
- ACTH which is also from pituitary gland is down. 
- aldosterone has to be up since the pituitary gland's ACTH is down. 
- ACTH -> cortisol inc -> upreg alpha1 receptors on systemic arterioles -> inc BP.... 
	- **without this effect, BP is lower, so impetus for aldosterone to increase.**

recent weight gain + pituitary mass + **point tenderness + fracture + muscle weak = osteoporosis!!!**
cushing disease can present as osteoporosis and weight gain in a pt with pituitary adenoma.... 
- K+ can be decreased bc of the glucocorticoids in kidney sometimes acting as mineralocorticoids when they are in high amounts 
- fludrocortisone = treat addisons = glucocorticoids with high mineralocorticoid effect.... 
- ACTH = up due to cushing dz 

ADH = aquaporin insertion into CD. = **free watr resorption, making urine more concentrated**
**urinary specific gravity = another way of measuring concentration/diluteness of urine**!!!! up if it's concentrated down if it's dilute 

smoking + recent weight loss + confusion = **SIADH secondary to small cell brochogenic carcinoma**


small cell lung cancer paraneoplastic syndromes 
  SIADH = adh secretion 
- Cushing with ACTH 
- lambert-eaton syndrome
- neurologic/cerebellar dysfunction with anti-hu/yo antibodies

squamous cell lung cancer paraneoplasticI hypercalcemia with PTHrp!!! 

with psychogenic polydipsia, ADH will be LOW to allow for water micturition.... but serum sodium will be low bc the ADH is appropriately low. 


lithium causes nephrogenic diabetes insipitus!!! 
- PCT = always isotonic 
- JGA = always hypotonic bc it bridges the early DCT with afferent arterioles , so at the top of the thick ascending limb... meaning **after the masive ion reabsorption due to na/k/2cl symporters = dilute.**
- MCD/collecting duct = hypotonic in DI and psychogenic polydipsia 
- MCD = hypeertonic in siadh and dehydration 

and lithium also causes drug-induced thyroiditis!!!! 
- ADH is high and not low bc the hypothalamus and posterior pituitary function just fine so hypothalamus makes more ADH to compensate for **lack of receptor sensitivity at the kidney bc it's nephrogenic!!!**

NSAIDs long term causes analgesic nephropathy which will cause renal dz = nephrogenic DI 

secondary hyperthyroidism = a TRH or TSH secreting tumor. 
primary hyperthyroidism. - graves dz ofc, toxic adenoma and toxic multindular goiter or transient thyroiditis (postpartum, dequervain, drug induced.)

"patchy uptake of iodine" = hashimotos - diffuse decrease of uptake. 
- increased menstrual irregularities, hepatic transaminitis, dyslipidmia, and myopathy 

in dequervain thyroiditis = **viral infection followed by painful and tender thyroid**
- spacing bt thyroid gland cells inc = release of preformed T3/4 into the blood.... not overproduction of it. 
- uptake always decreased even if patient is hyperthyoid in subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. 
- note that this can be **hyperthyroid or hypothyroid.**

medullary thyroid carcinoma = sr calcitonin elevated, and mostly euthyroid, but can be hypothyroid. 

Can T3 be converted to T4.? no! 

subclinical hypothyroidism 
- T3 and 4 not symptomatic yet so no change, but elevated TSH 

recovering in hospital from ARDs 2ndary to pancreatitis .... 
- euthyroid sick syndrome - TSH and T4 normal 
- T3 down and rT3 up... bc the T4 is not detectable in excess so it's converted to an inactive form of T3. T4 still in normal range 

TBG mops up free T4 

with TBG being low then the total T4 lower bc = total T4 = bound T4 and free t4. 


alcoholics susceptible to hypomagnesemia bc of dietary deficiency!!!!
- low mg -> hypocalcemia and hypokalemia **bc basal levels of mg is required for proper pth gland functioning!!!**
so low ca, high po4, low pth and low mg with alcoholism
