seizures - transietn epis of brain dysfuncton from abnromal firing of neurons groups 
epilepsy - periodic/unpredictable seizures 
these all treat the sypmtoms but not the underlying cause 
- can be genetic
- sturcutral or metabolic 
- congenital like wth cortical dysplasia, Tuberous sclerosis or acquired via stroke or trauma or electrolytes 
- idiopathic tooo ofc , largely we know it's this

things we can target
- hyperexcitability of many neurons
	- voltage gated Na+, C2+ , K+
	- many drugs will<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> **prolong inactivated state of vol-gated na+ channels** </mark>and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">poz modulation of K+ channels and straight up inhibit the ca2+ channels</mark>
	- also enhance GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition - Cl-
		- we have poz allosteric modulators of GABA-A
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">these are benzos like lorazepam and barbiturates phenoobarbital - this will make the GABA receptor more sensitvive</mark>
			- enhancing of GABa => Cl- inc conductance and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">membrane hyperpolarization.</mark>
		- we have inhibiting GABA metabolism - vigabatrin, valproate, topiramate 
		- blocking GABA reuptake - tiagabine 
- synchroniticity of a group of neurons 
	- other drugs will impact either vesicular proteins or particular subunits inside ion channels:
		  modulation of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">synaptic NT release via SV2A or Ca2+ channels with the alpha 2 delta subunit</mark>
			  levetiracetame; 
			  gabapentin + pregabalin on auxillary calcium channels ... 
	- diminish synaptic excitation mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors - with topiramate - AMPA, NMDA receptors 
- seizure types: 
	- focal seizure --partial seizure
		- foocal aware seizure / simple partial seizure - without impairment of awareness, convulsoisns of a single muslce groups or localized sensory disturbances, short 
		- focal impared awarenes seizure (complex partial seizure) = impaired awareness, bizzaree EEG gnerealized activity + **anterior temporal lobe focal abnormalities, purposeless movements up to 2 min**
		- focal to bilateral tonic clonic seizures - focal discharge causs behavioral events <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">before evolving into tonic-clonic seizures 1-2 min</mark>
	- gen onset - both hemispheres
		- absence seizures / petit mal - brief/abrupt loss of awareness
		- myoclonic seizures - clonic jerks isolated iwith brief busts of many spikes in EEG; can have juvenile things in this type too 
		- tonic-clinic seizure / grand mal - major convulsions, sequence of maximal tonic spasms of all body musculature + synchronius clonic jerking + prolonged depression of central function 
		- tonic seizures - opisthotonus + marked autonomic stuff
		- atonic seizures. - loss of postural tone - drop attacks with sagging of head falling 
	- status epilepticus - med emergency
		- more than 5 min 
		- 2nd seizure without recovering consciousness from the first
		- repeated seizures for 30 min or longer without recovery in bt 

epilepsy therapy - early dx 
- only use 1 drug when possible 
- onset of action is sloow... like w/ phenobarbital 
- initial dosing should be as low as possible 
- measure plasma levels for some meds like with phenytoin, carbamazepine, ethosuximide 
- change drugs gradually weaning off while ramping up the other 
- be aware of drug-drug intractions
- stopping drug therapy is seizure fre for 2 years with eeg normal 
- note - most of these are teratogenic ): 
- oral contraceptives + interaction => carbamazepine, phenobarbital = these inc risk of pregnancy be mindful
