Sleep med and sleep disorders (:

sleep medicine 
sleep is the most important thing to improve all symptoms 
sleep varies recommendations by age. generally 7-9 hrs for adults. 
basically 6-10 hrs is the best as possible. 
there's a u shaped curve, lesser or greater = bigger with too much sleep too like inc tau protein for upper limit too. 

4-5 sleep cycles normal sleep pattern 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">1-3 = nonREM </mark>
- stage 1 = transitional 
- majority of sleep = stage 2 ; slowly metabolic processes + muscle relax 
- stage 3 = deep sleep - lots of muscle regen + body stuff 
4th = REM sleep = gets closer to awake state. ; vivid dreaming + memory consolidation 
no more stage 4; just REM 

![[EEG chart primer.png]]
brain waves - think awake to sleeping 
awake stage = alpha waves basically 
stage 1 = beta waves
stage 2. = we have the theta waves with some <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">spindles which are thickened spots that look like alpha waves</mark> with a lot of small peak things plus <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">K-complexes which are randomlike inc in amplitude with negative + poz deflection</mark>
-<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> K complexes happen to block out outside noise to keep u asleep</mark>
- might have somthing to do with memory 
Stage 3 = d<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">elta sleep , slowly and deeper sleep </mark>
REM sleep = a lot of calming back to beta waves I think?

case 1 
- htn, 54 yo male hx 10 yr of loud snoring, gasping, 3x nocturia + non restorative sleep 
- 3 beers a night
- fam hx of snoring 
- bmi 30+ 
1. obstructive sleep apnea 
- repetitive eps of apnea or partial upper airway obstruction **hypopnea** most commonly at lvl of soft palate + tongue 
- has to be with 
- fragmentation of sleep/brief arousals, deoxy or re-oxy, heightened sympathetic activity, inc production of inflammatory and oxidative mediators 
- epidemiology - common, 2:1 male to female 
- poz family hx more common as we age + common in post-menopausal females 
- huge with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">obesity.</mark>
anatomic changes
- soft tissue - large tongue, tonsillar hypertrophy 
- skeeltal structural alterations like retrognathia, micrognathia
- parapharyngeal fat 
- also alterations in neuromuscular control - like inadequate compensation of phasic dilator muscle activity of upper airway + genioglossal muscles during sleep 
- ventilatory control. 
- arousability 
- high arched palate, crowded mouth with large tongue, narrow palate, long soft palate, large tonsils, long/wide uvula, retruded/small jaw, overjet. 
hx is key !! include both patient + bed partner. 
- pauses in breath/choking/gasping?
- night sweats
- nocturia too!!
- non-restorative sleep
- altered memory/mood
- daytime sleepiness - asking about **sleepy driving/near-crashes!!!!**
- HTN too as a huge factor as a cmorbidity !!!!
- larg circumference in neck: 17 in in men, 15.5 - 16 in in women 
look into: hypothyroidism, acromegaly, hunter syndrome, down syndrome, PCOS 

associated conditions with OSA:
- cognitive/neuropsychlogical 
	- EDS, depression, Mild cognitive impairment
- CV/cerebrovascular 
	- CAD, HTN, CHF , dysrhythmias, CVA, PulmHTN
- Endocrine
	- insulin resistence with DM2 
	- metabolic syndrome 
- high inc in MVCs and strokes in untreated OSAs
DX: we need to give a polysomnogram or HSAT!!!!
	polysomnogram - mix of EEG, EOG eye movements, nasal cannulla to look at flow, EKG , and EMG on legs + chin. 
	
- home sleep test - need o2 flow and change in heart rate, but no EEG = just to rule out sleep apnea .... <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this is a good starting point but not for dx.</mark>
	- looking at sleep studies in an EPOCH = a 30 second period when trying to stage someone's sleep , stage 2, 3, etc. 
	- respiratory events need to be seen in 2 minute stuffs
		- flat line - of respiratory flow, effort seen in chest + belly but no good airflow 
		- i<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ncongruent movement in chest and belly with chest moving inward, belly outwards</mark> 
- looking for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">AHI = apnea-hypopnea index</mark>
- number of partial or complete pauses in breathing per hour of sleep!!!
	- in adults
	- normal <5 / hr 
	- mild 5-15 / hr 
	- moderate 15-30 / hr 
	- severe 30+ / hr 
- management
	- 10-15% wt loss dc AHI by 26%
	- stop alc/sedating agents
	- notify anesthesia + surgery prior 
	- no sleepy driving  
- TREAT 
	- CPAP / BIPAP = poz airway pressure
	- oral appliances liek mandibular advancement
	- surgery for recalcitrant cases
	- MMA + hypoglossal nerve stimulator 
	- maxillar mandibular advancement particularly n kids bc lifelong CPAP in a child isn't that successful 

CASE 2 
- 63 yo fem, hx min snoring but fragmented + nonrestoragtive sleep + holding breath 
	- CHF hx , normal bp and bmi 
2. CENTRAL sleep apnea 
	- repetitive pauses in breathing during sleep based on an <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">absence of effort to breathe</mark>
- less common than obstructive, more common in male tho 
- most associated with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">congestive heart failure, also strokes, *opiates*, a-fib(circulation's not as conssitent), ESRD, high altitude, CCHS gene(congential hyperventilation syndrome, mainly seen in toddlers)</mark>
- snoring is somewhat minimal, and sleepiness too is huge
- irritability 
- choking 
- AM headacheS!!!! and insomnia is more prominent 
- possible PND and nocturnal angina due to o2 desats 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">instability of CNS controller mechs play a major role</mark>
	- inc resp drives due to inc peripheral + central ventilatory responsiveness to CO2
	- low PaCO2 lvls close to apneic threshold when awake 
	- loop gain - stability of system controlled by feedback loops, and we get high loop gain in central sleep apnea 
		- this means our system's too sensitive and overreacts to breathing disturbances!!!
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">minor decs in CO2 from a normal breath trigger hyperventilation that's exagerrated.</mark>
		- hyperventilation = the CO2 drops too low, below apneic threshold aka the part at which breathing stops, speciically the PaCO2 below which spontaneous breathing ceases, 
		- so PaCO2 too low = resp control center in brain will cause breathing muscles to stop getting signals that cause breathing -> apnea!!! only will breath again with highr PaCO2
- physical exam!!!
	- stigmata of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CHF or CVA</mark>
	- DX: objective testing - we want to do a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">in-lab sleep study bc home test is just for OSA</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">AHI 5+ , with over 50% events being central. there's respiratory flattening AND flattened lines from everything else no breathing and muscle effort at all.</mark>
- TREAT: more challengng
	- treat underlying CV dz , tapering opiates
	- can be effective - pap therapy 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">very effective - adaptive servo-ventillation , but it's not used for CSA with EF less than 45 percent....</mark> - this might inc mortality due to dec CO with ASV

Case 3 
- 17 yo, 3 yrs sleepiness, reducing alertness, jello legs, naps when back from school, tired, father with OSA and fam hx, norm phys ex 
3. Narcolepsy!!!
- hypersomnia with unusual proclivity to transition rapidly from wake to REM sleep 
- this is chronic CNS disorder and not curable but treatable 
	1. TYpe 1 narcolepsy - with cataplexy 
		1. lower orexin/reduced/absent!!!!! this was key for control of sleep, appetite, arousal, muscle tone 
		2. suggestion due to selective loss of orexin neurons in lateral hypothalamus due to *autoimmune attack?*
		3. cataplexy - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">loss of bilateral muscle tone with emotion!</mark>
	2. Type 2 = without cataplexy 
- less common than OSA, seen commonly in teens + later in life
- genetic - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">HLA DQB1 etc. and some familial association</mark>
- sypmtpoms = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">excessive daytime sleepiness</mark>
- sleep paralysis 
- hypnagogic(as ur falling asleep)/hypnopompic(as ur waking up) hallucinations - usually visual but can be otherwise 
- DX: hx is critical + consider commonness of sleep paralysis and otherwise. sleep maintenance insomnia like fragmented sleep/multiple arousals is 50% 
	- overnight sleep study to rule out other sleep disorders , establishing 6+ hrs of sleep 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">multiple sleep latency test - MLST</mark>
		- like multiple 5 naps spaced thruout the day, 2 hrs apart!
		- testing latency = time until sleep less than <8 min is abnormal 
		- number of REM onsets ; having 2+ within a sleep period of 15 min or less is abnormal 
- LABS: HLA DQB1*602 
- and CSF <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hypocretin/orexin levels, like less than 1/3 control</mark>
- TREAT: suficient sleep + goood hygiene , no sleepy driving, cousneling support members, planned naps 
	- alerting agents - like enhancing DA activity like methylpenidate, amphetamine, dextroamphetaminene promoting release + block eruptatk of DA, 5HT, NE
	- antidepressants will suppress REM to treat cataplexy 
	- for EDS and cataplexy - sodium oxybate which are GHB receptor GABA metabolites.... but they are regulated heavily
---
CASE 4 
- 68 yo ,, acting out dreams, unpleasant content in dreams, but doens't remember details
4.  REM sleep behavior disorder - a parasomnia whre one acts out bad dreams
	- REM should be marked by paralysis except diaphragm + extraocular muscles ; but this is where we paradoxically lose that normal atonia in REM 
	- more common in men 
	- more when we age
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">assciation with alpha-synucleinopathies like most ppl with RBD and eventually get parkinsons! - seen with PD, multiple system atrophy and dementia with lewy bodies</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">association with use of anti-depressants/anti-psychotics and narcolepsy</mark>
- pathophys - loss of normal inhibition in spinal motor neurons in REM sleep + motor activity seen due to that
	- alpha synuclein depo in brainstem !!! pons dysfunction association 
- physical findings - look for stigmata of like parkinson's , bruising/other injuries 
- DX: hx is critical , or look for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sleepwalking, but know that in sleepwalking eyes are opened and with the REM sleep disorder eyes are closed</mark>
- moer prom in 2nd half of night 
- pseudoRBD = check for this with sleep study bc it might just be untreated sleep apnea 
- look for seizures + videos 
- MEDS that can cause this 
	- SSRIs, miratazapine 
- TREAT:
	- make sleeping place safe , remove triggers
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">melatonin is safe at higher doses!!!</mark>
	- cunsel on neurodegen disorders
---
child is wandering around etc. 
1. sleepwalking - somnambulism
	- in the first 1/3 of night when <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">deep sleep is prominent</mark>
	- partial arousla with leaving the bed 
	- hard to arouse from sleep + little memory 
	- eyes open 
	- up to 40% in kids + 4% in adults and genetics too 
- DX: hx and multiple sleep studies maybe to check for injury or seizures
- TREAT: - conservative recs, episodes will dissipate, wind chime at door , avoid precipitants like insuffficent sleep, chaotic bed/wake times , consider if it's sleep apnea, stress causes triggers 

---
6. sleep terrors
- partial arousal disorders seen in kids 
- piercing cries, inconsolable, autonomc activyt, rapid breathes, heart rate up, sweating etc. 
- 1/3 first period of sleep during slow wave sleep 
- rare iin adults 
- DX/treatment - hx, conservative/reassurance to parents to not awaken the kids. kids don't actually remember or get impacted by this lmfao
