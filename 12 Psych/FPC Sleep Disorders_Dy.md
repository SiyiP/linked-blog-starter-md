Sleep med and sleep disorders (:

sleep medicine 
sleep is the most important thing to improve all symptoms 
sleep varies recommendations by age. generally 7-9 hrs for adults. 
basically 6-10 hrs is the best as possible. 
there's a u shaped curve, lesser or greater = bigger with too much sleep too like inc tau protein for upper limit too. 

4-5 sleep cycles normal sleep pattern 
1-3 = nonREM 
- stage 1 = transitional 
- majority of sleep = stage 2 ; slowly metabolic processes + muscle relax 
- stage 3 = deep sleep - lots of muscle regen + body stuff 
4th = REM sleep = gets closer to awake state. ; vivid dreaming + memory consolidation 
no more stage 4; just REM 

![[EEG chart primer.png]]
brain waves - think awake to sleeping 
awake stage = alpha waves basically 
stage 1 = beta waves
stage 2. = we have the theta waves with some <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">spindles which are thickened spots that look like alpha waves</mark> with a lot of small peak things plus <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">K-complexes which are randomlike inc in amplitude with negative + poz deflection</mark>
- K complexes happen to block out outside noise to keep u asleep
- might have somthing to do with memory 
Stage 3 = delta sleep , slowly and deeper sleep 
REM sleep = a lot of calming back to beta waves I think?

case 1 
- htn, 54 yo male hx 10 yr of loud snoring, gasping, 3x nocturia + non restorative sleep 
- 3 beers a night
- fam hx of snoring 
- bmi 30+ 
1. obstructive sleep apnea 
- repetitive eps of apnea or partial upper airway obstruction **hypopnea** most commonly at lvl of soft palate + tongue 
- has to be with 
- fragmentation of sleep/brief arousals, deoxy or re-oxy, heightened sympathetic activity, inc production of inflammatory and oxidative mediators 
- epidemiology - common, 2:1 male to female 
- poz family hx more common as we age + common in post-menopausal females 
- huge with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">obesity.</mark>
anatomic changes
- soft tissue - large tongue, tonsillar hypertrophy 
- skeeltal structural alterations like retrognathia, micrognathia
- parapharyngeal fat 
- also alterations in neuromuscular control - like inadequate compensation of phasic dilator muscle activity of upper airway + genioglossal muscles during sleep 
- ventilatory control. 
- arousability 
- high arched palate, crowded mouth with large tongue, narrow palate, long soft palate, large tonsils, long/wide uvula, retruded/small jaw, overjet. 
hx is key !! include both patient + bed partner. 
- pauses in breath/choking/gasping?
- night sweats
- nocturia too!!
- non-restorative sleep
- altered memory/mood
- daytime sleepiness - asking about **sleepy driving/near-crashes!!!!**
- HTN too as a huge factor as a cmorbidity !!!!
- larg circumference in neck: 17 in in men, 15.5 - 16 in in women 
look into: hypothyroidism, acromegaly, hunter syndrome, down syndrome, PCOS 

associated conditions with OSA:
- cognitive/neuropsychlogical 
	- EDS, depression, Mild cognitive impairment
- CV/cerebrovascular 
	- CAD, HTN, CHF , dysrhythmias, CVA, PulmHTN
- Endocrine
	- insulin resistence with DM2 
	- metabolic syndrome 
- high inc in MVCs and strokes in untreated OSAs
DX: we need to give a polysomnogram or HSAT!!!!
	polysomnogram - mix of EEG, EOG eye movements, nasal cannulla to look at flow, EKG , and EMG on legs + chin. 
	
- home sleep test - need o2 flow and change in heart rate, but no EEG = just to rule out sleep apnea .... <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this is a good starting point but not for dx.</mark>
	- looking at sleep studies in an EPOCH = a 30 second period when trying to stage someone's sleep , stage 2, 3, etc. 
	- respiratory events need to be seen in 2 minute stuffs
		- flat line - of respiratory flow, effort seen in chest + belly but no good airflow 
		- i<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ncongruent movement in chest and belly with chest moving inward, belly outwards</mark> 
- looking for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">AHI = apnea-hypopnea index</mark>
- number of partial or complete pauses in breathing per hour of sleep!!!
	- in adults
	- normal <5 / hr 
	- mild 5-15 / hr 
	- moderate 15-30 / hr 
	- severe 30+ / hr 
- management
	- 10-15% wt loss dc AHI by 26%
	- stop alc/sedating agents
	- notify anesthesia + surgery prior 
	- no sleepy driving  
- TREAT 
	- CPAP / BIPAP = poz airway pressure
	- oral appliances liek mandibular advancement
	- surgery for recalcitrant cases
	- MMA + hypoglossal nerve stimulator 
	- maxillar mandibular advancement particularly n kids bc lifelong CPAP in a child isn't that successful 

CASE 2 
- 63
