#psych 

kids start picking up moms eating habits at 2-3 
many cartoons, and it's super prevasive 

complex etiology - 
genetics/neurobio 
dieting behavior , hx of family hx 
weight conscious sport like wreslting 
trauma hx 

obesity is very stigmatized - drs are the worst offenders about the perpetuation of this. 

diet + exercise isn't the only thing to lose weight 
- it's too normalized + focus on ideals + how we talk about it 


1. anorexia nervosa - .6% prevalence
	1. median onset 18 yrs , peaks of 12-13 and 18-19 
	2. males are there
	3. restricting type = so that they can't make needs so that their body weight fear is compulsed
		1. primary behavior is restricting 
	4. binge/purge type 
		1. b/p and between these they restrict 
		2. during past 3 mon, b/p behavior 
	5. low body weight in context of age/sex/trajectory, etc
	6. bmi <18.5 
	7. note - amenorrhea no longer a criteria 
	8. med comps due to intake starvation DIRECTLY 
		1. hypothermia, hypotension, extra hair on extremities, dry skin, bradycardia, edema of extremities, cardiac murmur 
		2. body "slows down" = hepatitis by starvation. 
		3. electrolytes 
		4. pancytopenia 
		5. we can see autonomic instabiliity at end 
		6. bone health = amenorrhea and osteoporosis 
	9. very high mortality 
2. bulimia nervosa = median age 18 
	1. more normative eating in bt b/p 
	2. binging = 
		1. eating objectively large amt of food, 
		2. past comfortable fullness
		3. loss of control f eating 
		4. significant guilt after eating 
		5. more than 1x a week for 3 mon 
		6. recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior 
			1. vomitting, lax, diuretics, extreme exercise 
	3. note relats to method of compensatory behavior 
	4. dental erosions, ulcers, reflux, abd bloating, cardiac arrhythmias, callouses on hands 
	5. electrolyte abnormalities (more bicarb, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis</mark>) chronic dehydration, edema, AKI , constipation, sialadenitis parotid gland infection and swellning 
	6. hypokalemic , hypophosphatemia 
	7. dizziness, ekg abnormalities
3. BED 
	1. binging without purging 
	2. binge fullness, much distress
	3. on avg 1x/week for 3 mon
	4. no compensatory behavior
4. OSFED - other specified feeding + eating dz 
	1. significant distress + impairment
	2. not full criteria of AN, BN, BED
	3. most common !!!
	4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">atypcial anorexia nervosa = no bmi criteria for AN</mark>
		1. bmi is really not useful mostly 
	5. bulimia nervosa with low freq/duration of purging 
	6. bEd with low freq or limited duration 
	7. purging dz 
EDs dont look like how ppl expect usually 
- some are super heatlhy-focused and then really really serious with dieting 
1. ARFID 
	1. avoiding/restircting food intake, **not body img drive**n , lack of interest 
	2. significant weight loss
	3. need for suplement
	4. impaired psychosocial functioning 
	5. might need to subtype this 
	6. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">not picky eating - some nutritional need is not met, and some supplement is needed.</mark>
	7. this can also be brought on. for depression or some kind of unknown medical region 


- parents/family dysfunciton don't necessarily cause them. 
- ppl with those don't wanna be sick! tremendous suffering
- they need help or support bc of their thoughts and emotions
- EDOs are not about control; the disease is in control and not the typical cause 
- ppl do fully recover from eating disorders - 
	- it's not true that they dont' ever do it!
- amenorrhea is NOT normal for atheletes

signs/symptoms
- weight loss/gain 
- change in mood/performance
- diet talk/books/mags/food shows
- fatigue
- sudden interest in cooking for others
- sudden decision to become vegetarian/veg 
- picky eating/healthy food 
- always going to bathrooms after meal 
- half die from med complications other half die from suicide 
- higher mortality 
	- older age of presentation 
	- comorbid SUD 
	- lower bmi at presentation 
	- comorbidieis of psych disorder 
challenges
- missing atypical presentations
- poor historian 
- low index of suspicion among; minorities, males, chronically ill ppl, lower SES populations, adults 
comprehensive assessment
- do you have rules about food? 
- not allowed to eat after time, calories? rituals. frequency of behaviros/ distress - "what do u think ur body should weigh"
- how hard or easy would it be if ur dr said u had to gain x lbs to be healthy 
nutritional assessment
- 24 hr recall
- foods eaten/avoided
- id of potential vitamin/nutrient deficiencies 


refeeding syndrome
- uncommon but life threatening
- fluid + electrolyte shifts when malnourished person starts eating
- insulin frm glucose -> production of glycoogen, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">drives K+ and phosphorous into cells therefore your serum levels drop sooo much and u don't have much to begin with</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">depletion of ATP and 2,3-DPG , resp muscle/diaphragm weakness, HF, rhabdomyolysis, seizure</mark>
- supplement electrolytes prir to feeding
- id at risk ppl with extreme issues
	- 5-10 days prolonged fasting 
	- rapid weight loss 
	- <70% EBW 
	- feed ppl more 
	- peaks in 72-84 hrs 

EDO treatment 
- nutritional rehab/weight restoration is initial goal + imprerative
	- early nutritional restoration and management of comorbidities is the biggest thing 
- psychotherapeutic interventions only 
- lvl of care dpeendent on med compliications, insurance, fam/patient preference
	- high lvl of care != improved outomes!!! 

fmaily based treatment = FBT
- 1st line treat for adolescents with AN 
- evidence coming out for use with adolesents with bn 
- no blame to either parents or the ill adolescent
- getting them well - 

1. phase 1 - parents in change of weight erstoration 
2. phase 2 (sessions 11-16) = parents hand cntrol over eating back to adolescent 
3. phase 3 = discuss adolescent developmental isseus (17-20)
