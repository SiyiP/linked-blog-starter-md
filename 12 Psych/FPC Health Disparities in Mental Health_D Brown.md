sources of these - income, edu, housing, discrimination expouse

healthcare dispartieis - diff in quality of healthcare <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">that exist beyond known factors</mark> like access, ability to pay, insurance coverage, 
- bias
- discrimiination 
- stereotyping 

foundational dispartieis
- racial/ethnic ones exist even when everything else is the same, in the historic + cntemp ineuqality, can be due to all the big 3 from healthcare provider side 
- raical + ethni minority are more liely to refuse treatment creating dispartieis 

cycle.f doom 
- interconnected impact - where disadvantaged with pooorer health are more likely to already struggle in system 
- reinforcement of inequities - consistent lower quality care for groups worsens their own overall health outcomes 

determinants of health dispartieis
- race, gende,r disability, oreitntatin, and SES 


mental health dispartieis
- minorities have similar sometimes fewer cases of mental illness iwith more serious consequences
	- higher burden of disability 
	- may have lower rates but it's more persistent
	- more common in incarcerated ppl 
	- racial/ethnic minority mental health issues subj to harsher disciplinary actions
	- misdx or not dx at all 
	- less lkely to get care 
shcool to prison pipeline - kids expelled and suspended missing critical time =more likelly to be incarcerated

disparities in latinos
- lower risk for psych disorders compared to nonhispanic whites
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">us born hispanics</mark> - higher rates of psych disorders due to stress/discrim
- hispanic adults+kids are very vulnerable with psych distresses linked with immigration + acculturation stress
- hispanics - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">more likley to get mental services from a pcp </mark>

asian disparities
- fewer serious psych illness
- lower sud compared to other groups
- suicide - leading cause of death in 15-24 
- aa/pis - less likely to seek mental health services from other racial / ethnic groups 

indigenous communities
- disproportionately high rates of sud/ptsd/attachment disorder
- historical trauma
- highest lifetime rates of mdd in children 
- disproportionate high suicide rates, earlier initiation of sud 
- need culturally sensitive care which often isn't given. think about the language we are using - and about approaching treatment with personalization and individualization of care

AA - often g<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">et poor quality of care only 1/3 ppl who need it receive care</mark>
- aab -<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> lower rates of mental health servic use but inpatient mental health care is higher</mark>
- more likely to be misdx with schizoprhrenia and less freq with mood disorders 
- aab with mental health conditions more likely to be incarcerated
- less included in research, and more liley to have to resort to emergency care or pcp over mental health specialists 

sources of rcial disparities in mental health 
- maltreatment/understandable mistrust 
- treatment seeking 
- lack f infroomation 
- stigma
- culture
- underreporting of symptoms
- substance use disorder 

in antebellum perioid 
- mental health needs of aa are largely ignored
- they were considered incapable of being mentally ill and the absence of this was used to jjustify slvavery 
- drapetomania - used to explain why ppl would try to runaway 
- mentla dx among them inc attributed to amancipation - but they were said to be paranoid/manic or display manic depression based on perceived stereotypical behavior

disparities in ptsd
- higher rates of trauma exposure/ptsd among minorities 
- aa = carry highest rates of ptsd
- associated with greater symptom severity, more functional impairment + more poor outcomes
- treatment seeking behaviors are lower than the norm among these minorties 
- ppl with less edu, access to insurance etc 

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">criterion A delimma !!!</mark>
- limited - must include a criterion A event
- "traumatic experience" is limited to death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or threated sexual violation 
- among ppl who experienced it, witnessed it happen , learned about it happening to a close relative/friend
- or thru repeated exposure to distressing details of an event 
racial discrimination is NOT a crierion a event for some reason... 
- but it can induce.a trauma reaction 

race related stress
- racial trauma
- an individual or groups stressful rxn to direct experiences of racial discrimation = conflict, hatred, injury or threatened harm based on their race
- can be
	- specific incident or ongoing phenomenon
	- overt/covert
	- direct or indirect
- not only associated with traumatic stress rxns but negative phys/mental health outcomes including stroke, diabetes, heart disease, obesity, depression , anxiety etc. 
it can cause ptsd and inc ptsd vulnerabiliity 

70% trauma symptoms linked to discrimination, strong relationships between this and racial discrimination are found , cna lead to more effective treatments for ptsd

dispartieis in alc use disorder
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">highest drinking binge use among indigenous ppl </mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">consequences of alc consumption more profound in AA + hispanic adult drinkers to report depenence symptoms + social consequences</mark>
- high riks drinking = more severe consequencs among racial minorities

disparities in opioid epidemic
- been inc in aa over last 8 years esp in urban areas
- inc by 44% in 2020 
- associated with criminal activitiy among them 
	- epidemic victims = nonblack
	- "c<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">riminal " = black victim of opioid epidemic , seen in how media portrayed the crack epidemic </mark>
	- fear lead to criminalization of a drug issue, they tried to get rid of ppl instead of the probem, leading to fale narrative of race and criminals , affecting how ppl treat black patietns and ppl today 
		- d<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">octors prescribe less oppioids to bl</mark>ack ppl 
		- but this is bad ): more barriers about pain in healthcare 
		- ppl addicted to opioids tend to still be associated with criminality 
- less than 15% of black ppl with oud are getting effective treatments! 
compassion vs indifference - "black drugs" and how double standards are 
- criminal crackdowns are still towards crack and weed 
- but <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">opioid is seen as a "crisis and epidemic victmizing it"</mark>

TREATMENT evidence based treatments
- noted - we need to be mindful that these therapeutic treatments are developped in the western world w maority white populations 
- cbt can show diffferential effectiveness by race in outcomes
- evidence based treatments are generalized and disseminated in society at large without consideraion of cultural differences and how tehse impact treatment efficacy 

we need to understand these variations to provide conext for hypothese that underlie ehtnoracial diffs and make dx practices/treatment
