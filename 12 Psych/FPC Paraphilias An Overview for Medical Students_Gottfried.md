---
sex offenses against minors who are pubescent or post pubesent are illegal but not pedophilic disorder. bc they're not in stage 1 

if multipe victims were <13 , pre pubsescent - ages place in concern with pedophilic disorder relevance to see if they have it 


note - not all ppl who commit sexual offenses have a dx paraphilic disorder and not all ppl with paraphilci disorder commit or are charged with a sexual crime
child moelstation or rape are legal terms and behavioral acts that don't autonmatically indicate a disorder

---
etiology - reasons why they have this 
nonconsentual + problematic sexual bheavior etiology 
- antisocial practices - might not meet full criteria for ASPD but will have this as most often
- intellectual disability = ppl with this is overrepresented. "emotional congruence with children." another possible reason for them to understand why theyshouldn't have sex with children . they still develop sexual urges
- another medical condition like neurocognitive disorders. might be someone who always had it but then lost their impulse control 
- severe mental illness ysmptoms like mania or hypersexuality 
- rarely impacts of medication 
- paraphilic sexual interest/disorders
- ppl with their own trauma hx = higher rates overrepresented int eh entire population. unfortunatley there's so so many ppl who survive and don't get to go and abuse another person 

prediction risk 
- pretrial - 
	- psychiatric disorder? 
	- what can u find 
	- family court - 
- post-guilt
	- sex offfender registry - doesnt' lead to anything good, causes suicide a lot + viigeillante case + no safety 
	- sentence = probation/ prison? 
- post-sentence / civil 
	- child custody = some version of this where they get civilly convicted and about to get released
	- so then we get sexually violent person act = 
		- evaluate ppl to see if they should actually be released

all in common - are they gonna do it again?
- dx input for etiology 
- treatment risk assessment
- management level dterination 

risk factors for ppl who might commit another sexual offense 
- sexual "deviancy" = having sexual interest in children and then antisocial characteristics
- any deviant sexual interest, sexual interest for children, sexual vioelcne and multipel paraphilias 
- antisocial characteristics
- never married
- mastrubatoion 
- conlicts in intimate relationships 
- grievance/hostility 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">unrelated to risk </mark>
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">- depression, poor victim empathy, poor social skills, lack of motivation for treatment during intake adn denial </mark>

how to measure arousal 
- ppg - penile emasure - to penis in respponse to sexual and nonsexual stimuli - presented: prepubescent children, adults, male and female 
- circumference chane is measured 
treatment: 
- improve quality of life
- public safety 
- good lives model - how can we create a life that we wanna live where we don't mess it up for everyone 
- CBT - confront thinking errors
- relapse preention 
- id triggers = reinforce problems iwth sex addiction tho ): 
- behavioral 
	- consition/decondition fantases/urges/behavirs
	- not rlly helpful 
- psychodynamic/analytic
	- not shown to be effective in paraphilic disorers
- pharmacological 

does treatment work
- yea but hard to study 
- no funding for this 
healthy sexual functioning should be assessed in every exam. 
genral eval 
- is there anything about your sex life you'd like to change? 
- use common terminology - always ask what does the slang ur using meaN? 
- consult as you need it too!
