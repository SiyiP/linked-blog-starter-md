readily reversible state ! absene of wakefulness, unconscious but active! happens recurrent + periodic 

no disease state is not worsened by lack of sleep or poor qualidy 

why sleep takes place
- immune function - affecting cytokine/cytokine receptor levels
- poor sleep = infection suseptibility 
- tnf-alpha , IL-1 beta all rises due to this sl
- decreases calori use, glucose utilization so it would also let replete glycogen + ATP 
- some removal of toxins too maybe like amyloid-beta from the CNS 
- and enhances neuronal plasticity 

EEG - brief primer? 
![[EEG chart primer.png]]
- when activity is slow = delta , slow wave sleep 
- theta 
- beta = frontally when we're awake too 
- alpha = when we are awake. predominantly 

sleep stages
- awake stage = W = alpha rhythm predominent bgd 
- stage 1 sleep = N1 = theta activity - just starting to get to sleeep, loss of waking bgd, vertex waves
- stage 2 sleep = N2 = 
	- sleep spindles (generated by thalamocortical circuits; this is a huge 13-16 hz frontocentrally maximal activity that lasts for .5 seconds)
		- generated by GABA-ergic thalamic reticular neurons 
	- K complexes (huge wave that looks like a hill) produced by the thalamus when there's some type of external stimulation trying to wake u up; theta + beta EEG; 
- stage 3.  = N3,  delta waves ; we see .5-1 hz slow waves most of the time for more than 25% of the record 
- REM sleep = low amplitude EEG predominantly more beta>>alpha activity 

sleep in cycles - 
- N1 biref
- N2 = 50-55% of nights
- N3 = 15-20 % 
- REM = 20-25% of your time
- cycles are like 90 minutes 
- ideally you get 4-5 cycles a night 
- slow wave sleep = early part of night usually; usually we get dreaming  
- REM sleep = late part of night 

physiologic changes
- awake - baseline
- and as we go from N1->N3 we get HR , respirations down and muscle tone down as well, all decreasing ; parasypmathetic 
- REM sleep = **physiologically similar to awake, HR normal , respirations high**, and muscle tone all the way down ; like you're dreaming. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">definitive: muscle tone is NONEXISTENT. full body paralysis</mark>

circadian rhythm 
- inner clock , sync via light ; 24.2 hrs , need input from the sun. 
- light = intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells = ipRGC
	- these are like 1% and they're responsible for our rhythm, 
	- contains **melanopsin, respnoding maximally to blue light.**
	- ipGRC -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">suprachiasmatic nucleus of hypothalamus</mark> (controls all of the thalamus); gving off ACH 
	- -> superior cervical ganglion -> pineal gland 
	- pineal gland -< pinealocytes -> melatonin 
		- note melatonin inc as light decreases. peak is from 2-4 AM 
		- continuous light = will be maximally suppressing it, 15 minutes is enough to doo that!!! 

neurotransmitters
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ACH = starting REM sleep, pons and basal forebrain to initiate it </mark>
- GABA - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">regulation of suprachiasmatic nucleus. </mark> -> preoptic hypothalamus -> thalamic reticular nuclei 
	- this r<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">egulates non-REM N1,2,3 and the thalamic reticular nuclei which helps generation of sleep spindles </mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">serotonin + norepinephrine = from midbrian and pons,</mark>
	- high lvls = wakefullness
	- low lvls = non-REM sleep
- dopamine = from midbrain and pons, promotion of wakefulness 
neuropeptides
- orexin = from hypothalamus laterally, improve wakefulness
- MCH - melanin concentrating hormone, hypothalamus laterally, improve REM 
-
- adenosine - from basal forebrain + cortex, dec wakefulness. 

circadian rhythm would impact - 
- hormones like temp, potassium, cortisol, melatonin, grown hoormone and more... 

disorders/path 
1. irr<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">egular sleep-wave rhythm disorder</mark>
	1. dysfunction or <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">destruction of suprachiasmatic nucleus </mark>
	2. completely<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> fragmented sleep cycles unrelat</mark>ed to time of the day 
	3. dementia, tumors, trauma can all cause this 
	4. they sleep whenever they feel like it, no pattern
2. n<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">on-24-hr sleep-wake phase disorder</mark>
	1. seen in tota<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">lly blind ppl </mark>
	2. no light -> no melatonin, no more retinal input which resets the rhythm from 24.2 hours to 24 hours. 
	3. **every day, u wake<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> up a little later than u do befor</mark>e, and ur cycle will move bit by bit for no reason**
	4. TREAT: melatonin + melatonin receptor agonists 
3. advanced + delayed sleep hpase syndrome
	- when ur circadian rhythm is more pronounced than 24.2 hours
	- each has a strong gneetic component! 
	1. delayed sleep phase syndrome - stable bedtime, but it's 3-6 hrs later than desired. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">most common disorder</mark>
		1. treat: melatonin, melatonin recepotr agonists
	2. advanced sleep phase syndrome- stable bedtime 3+ hours earlier than conventional times. 
		1. happens in older adults!!!
		2. going to bed like 7-8 pm every day 
		3. TREAT: light therapy 
4. narcolepsy 
	1. excessive daytime sleepiness in spite of adequate sleep in evening 
	2. hypnagogic/hypnapompic hallucinations !!! <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">as they enter and awake from sleep, they get dreams they can't distinguish from reality</mark>
	3. sleep paralysis - can't move for first few minutes - happens to ppl who are sleep deprived too
	4. cataplexy - not reuqired but seen; <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">someone caused by emotional stimulation, they would lose motor tone and fall to the ground and get rem sleep</mark>
		1. sudden temp loss of muscle tone, triggered by strong emotions like laughter etc. 
	5. pathophys
		1. genetics + autoimmune **t-cell mediiated process**
		2. eventually leads to decrease in orexin-A and B, which will maintain wakefullness in the hypothalamus 
		3. wakefulness promoting transmitters = histamine, dopamine, NE, serotonin, aCH
	6. TREAT:
		1. sleepiness = schedule naps, driving safely , stimulants using: methylphenidate, pitolisant, sodium oxybate, etc. 
		2. Sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations - l antidepressants which will decrease time spent in REM sleep!!! like TCAs,SSRIs, SSNRIs 
		3. Cataplexy - same as the REM sleep decreasers like antidepressants but also sodium oxybate which can be sedating 
5. REM sleep behavior disorder
	1. when the neurons of the sublateral dorsal nucleus of pons/SDN stop working 
		1. feeds into the spine originally responsible for paralysizing during REM 
		2. happens in parkinson's dz, lewy body dementia 
		3. or dmg to SDN 
		4. so muscle activity = acting our your dreams in the last 1/3 of night, behavior correlates with dream content, this is basically just dream enacting behavior. 
		5. hug safety concern 
6. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">NonREM parasomnias - not associated with dream contents aka the person doesnt really remember</mark>
	- happens i<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">n first 1/3 of night, worsens with alterations in sleep schedule or routine </mark>
	- TREAT: reassurance 
	- note - **non-benzodiazepine GABAa receptor agonists can inc the incidence of parasomnias**; like ambien 
	1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sleep-walking</mark>, peaking 8-12 yrs, purposeless walking 
	2. sleep <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">terror</mark> = in young, 4-12 yrs - agitated, runs, screaming, tachycardia, etc. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">they don't remember what happens</mark>
7. obstructive sleep apnea
	1. repeated resp effort related airway obstruction during sleep 5+ per hours
	2. obstruction of airway by tongue/soft tissues
	3. this is super underdx!!! very hug 
	4. RF = obesity , more in men, seen when older, nasal congestion, small crowde palate, tobacco. 
		1. and in kids - adenoid/tonsillar hypertrophy 
	5. STOP-BANG 
		1. snoring, tired, observed you stop breathing during sleep, high bp? 
		2. on exam, BMI 35+ , age50+, neck circumference 40 cm+ ? gender male? 
		3. yes to 3 items = refer for sleep testing 
	6. inc risk for: htn, cardiac arrthythmias, vascular dz, NAFLD, perioperative mortality 
	7. dx with : polysomnogram/sleep study 
	8. TREAT: weight loss, CPAP, dental appliance if mild, tonsillectomy for kids, airway/hypoglossal stimulators if severe
8. insomnia + sleep.... 
	1. due to other conditions most likely - pain, depression, anxiety, hyperthyroidism, stressors, med SEs, nocturia, sleep apnea 
	2. huge : sleep hygiene - get a nighttime routine, healthy environment, exercise, reduce stress, avoid large meals 
	3. MED: 
		1. GABAa receptor agonists non benzodiazepine - effective shorterm like zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopiclone 
		2. melatonin receptor agonists like ramelteon, tasimelteon; used the most probably
		3. short acting benzodiazepines = temazepam; can cause habituation  
		4. dual orexin receptor antagonists - suvorexant, daridorexant, lemborexant ;  
		5. use these pareingly in the short term only ; cannot use this to compensate for poor sleep hygiene
	4. chronic treatment - CBT - establish healthy sleep hygiene - interrupt the cycle of sleep anxiety, the anxiety abt not being able to sleep makes things way worse!!! 
	5. 


brief stimulant pharmacology 
- s<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">odium oxybate</mark> - boost GABA-b, which will <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inc amt of time in nonREM sleep </mark>
- methylphenidate, amphetamines = al<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">l NE / dopa reuptake inhibitors, so more presynaptic NE/dopamne release </mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pitolisant = histamine H3 antag </mark>= more ACH, NE, andDA 
- Soiriamfetol = another stimulant, NE/Dopa reuptake inhibitors 
- modafanil / armodafinil - NE/dopa reuptake inhibitor but in the hypothalamus this time 
not for narcolepsy but 
- caffeine AND theobromine, in chocolate = adenosine antag 

normal rem sleep 
1. medial prefrontal cortex -> orexin 
2. orexin to turn REM ON:
	1. sends signals to glutamatergic neurons of pons sublateral dorsal nucleus or SDN -> cholinergic nuerons of the pontine reticular formation AND glycine +GABA neurons in spinal cord which **turn off muscle tone**
3. orexin to turn REM OFF:
	1. GABA neurons of midbrain / ventrolateral periaqueductal gray + ventrolateral nucleus -> cholinergic neurons of pons reticular formation
