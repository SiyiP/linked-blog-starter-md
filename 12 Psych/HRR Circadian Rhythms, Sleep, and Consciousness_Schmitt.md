readily reversible state ! absene of wakefulness, unconscious but active! happens recurrent + periodic 

no disease state is not worsened by lack of sleep or poor qualidy 

why sleep takes place
- immune function - affecting cytokine/cytokine receptor levels
- poor sleep = infection suseptibility 
- tnf-alpha , IL-1 beta all rises due to this sl
- decreases calori use, glucose utilization so it would also let replete glycogen + ATP 
- some removal of toxins too maybe like amyloid-beta from the CNS 
- and enhances neuronal plasticity 

EEG - brief primer? 
![[EEG chart primer.png]]
- when activity is slow = delta , slow wave sleep 
- theta 
- beta = frontally when we're awake too 
- alpha = when we are awake. predominantly 

sleep stages
- awake stage = W = alpha rhythm predominent bgd 
- stage 1 sleep = N1 = theta activity - just starting to get to sleeep, loss of waking bgd, vertex waves
- stage 2 sleep = N2 = 
	- sleep spindles (generated by thalamocortical circuits; this is a huge 13-16 hz frontocentrally maximal activity that lasts for .5 seconds)
		- generated by GABA-ergic thalamic reticular neurons 
	- K complexes (huge wave that looks like a hill) produced by the thalamus when there's some type of external stimulation trying to wake u up; theta + beta EEG; 
- stage 3.  = N3,  delta waves ; we see .5-1 hz slow waves most of the time for more than 25% of the record 
- REM sleep = low amplitude EEG predominantly more beta>>alpha activity 

sleep in cycles - 
- N1 biref
- N2 = 50-55% of nights
- N3 = 15-20 % 
- REM = 20-25% of your time
- cycles are like 90 minutes 
- ideally you get 4-5 cycles a night 
- slow wave sleep = early part of night usually; usually we get dreaming  
- REM sleep = late part of night 

physiologic changes
- awake - baseline
- and as we go from N1->N3 we get HR , respirations down and muscle tone down as well, all decreasing ; parasypmathetic 
- REM sleep = **physiologically similar to awake, HR normal , respirations high**, and muscle tone all the way down ; like you're dreaming. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">definitive: muscle tone is NONEXISTENT. full body paralysis</mark>

circadian rhythm 
- inner clock , sync via light ; 24.2 hrs , need input from the sun. 
- light = intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells = ipRGC
	- these are like 1% and they're responsible for our rhythm, 
	- contains **melanopsin, respnoding maximally to blue light.**
	- ipGRC -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">suprachiasmatic nucleus of hypothalamus</mark> (controls all of the thalamus)
	- -> superior cervical ganglion -> pineal gland 
	- pineal gland -< pinealocytes -> melatonin 
		- note melatonin inc as light decreases. peak is from 2-4 AM 
		- continuous light = will be maximally suppressing it, 15 minutes is enough to doo that!!! 

neurotransmitters
- ACH = starting REM sleep, pons and basal forebrain to initiate it 
- GABA - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">regulation of suprachiasmatic nucleus. </mark> -> preoptic hypothalamus -> thalamic reticular nuclei 
	- this regulates non-REM N1,2,3 and the thalamic reticular nuclei which helps generation of sleep spindles 
- serotonin + norepinephrine = from midbrian and pons,
	- high lvls = wakefullness
	- low lvls = non-REM sleep
- dopamine = from midbrain and pons, promotion of wakefulness 
neuropeptides
- orexin = from hypothalamus laterally, improve wakefulness
- MCH - melanin concentrating hormone, hypothalamus laterally, improve REM 
-
- adenosine - from basal forebrain + cortex, dec wakefulness. 

circadian rhythm would impact - 
- hormones like temp, potassium, cortisol, melatonin, grown hoormone and more... 

disorders/path 
1. irregular sleep-wave rhythm disorder
	1. dysfunction or destruction of suprachiasmatic nucleus 
	2. completely fragmented sleep cycles unrelated to time of the day 
	3. dementia, tumors, trauma can all cause this 
	4. they sleep whenever they feel like it, no pattern
2. non-24-hr sleep-wake phase disorder
	1. seen in totally blind ppl 
	2. no li
