readily reversible state ! absene of wakefulness, unconscious but active! happens recurrent + periodic 

no disease state is not worsened by lack of sleep or poor qualidy 

why sleep takes place
- immune function - affecting cytokine/cytokine receptor levels
- poor sleep = infection suseptibility 
- tnf-alpha , IL-1 beta all rises due to this sl
- decreases calori use, glucose utilization so it would also let replete glycogen + ATP 
- some removal of toxins too maybe like amyloid-beta from the CNS 
- and enhances neuronal plasticity
