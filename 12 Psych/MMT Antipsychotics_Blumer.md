this is mainly a SE lecture - MOA are all similar. 
diff bt first gen + atypical antipsych = huge profile switch are done. 

poz symptoms of psychoses= most of the drugs treat these 
- delusions - fixed false beliefs not shared by others
- hallucinatns= perceptions disconnencted from external stimuli ... common auditory 
- illusions - severely distorted perceptions or misinterpretations of stimuli like seeing a pulsating obj 
- ideas of ref - ordinary objs have specific msgs for the person
- delusions of ref = person having beliefs can't question them 
- thought insertion/deletion = idea that outside agency removes or adds thoughts to their brain 
- disorg speech
- disorg behavior 
neg symptoms of psychoses = 2nd gen drugs are slightly better at treating these ): but ni general we don't have a lot 
- flattened/blunted affect
- amotivation
- asociality 
- alogia - poverty of speech 

target symptoms of this:
- cognitive deficits 
- pts with schizoprenia have basic sensori-motor skills + associative abilities but deficits in tasks that req symbolic or verbal representation 
- treat familiar associations as if they're unusual 
- deficits in working memory or scratch pad memory , holding goals, plans, etc 
indications for these antipsychotics
- schizophrenia, biplar dz, depression, autism, tourettes many uses!!!! 

psychosis = dopamine hypothesis 
- basically infers... that excessive dopamine activity is the cause underlying this ... 
- so classical D2 receptor blocking might alleviate poz symptoms of shcizophrenia 
- but all these drugs block D2 receptors.... but therapeutic benefit only seen after days-weeks
- however we might have other things than dopamine treating and or worsening psychoses. 
major dopamine pathways 
1. mesocortical/mesolimbic tracts
	1. projects from the VTA ventral tegmental area to prefrontal cortex, nigras accubens, and hippocampus extension 
	2. this is what we target to get rid of the poz symptoms 
	3. d2 receptors = we can't target fully to these areas so we block the D2 in the nigrostriatal tract + tuberinfundibular tract
2. nigrostriatal tract/extrapyramidal pathway
	1. from substantia nigra to dorsal striatum 
	2. modulates motor behavior 
	3. we get parkinsonian symptoms on these drugs, shuffling gait, tremors etc 
3. tuberoinfundibular tract 
	1. projects from arcuate nuc to the pituitary 
	2. dopamine inhibits prolactin secretions 
	3. so we would get prolactin release - causing sexual SEs like gyno etc..
4. serotnergic systems
	1. 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors are in the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">negative</mark> symptoms of schizophrenia 
	2. newer agent slike clozapine + risperidone have equal or greater affiniity for the 5-HT2A rec than the D2 rec 
	3. but antipsychotics that are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">atypical, having a high affinity antagonistic activity at the 5-HT2A receptors are more effective at treating negative symptoms than the clasical D2 receptor blockers while having fewer AE of motor origin. but not alone effective.</mark>
5- cliniical effects of antipsychotics
- reducing hallucination + paranoia also calming + reducing agitation 
- helps with mania/depression = in bipolar dz 
- they don't work well due to negative symptoms + cog issues
	- these do a good job at schizophrenia 
	- SEs: extrapyramidal symptoms, hyperprlactinemia, weight gain, CV risk up, seizures, qtc , sedation, orthostatic hypotension 
	- huge SEs ):  = CV and cardiometabolic risks cause their life expectancy to go way down 
		- more prevelant are metabolic syndrome, ddiabetes, CV releated mortality, drugs make them gain weight, obesity, disbtes, HTN. 
		- hard pt management due to this ): 
	- notorous - EPS = extrapyramidal symptoms happen soon due to nigrostriatal pathway D2 receptors getting blocked
		- dystonia - in face/neck/back 
		- parkinsonian effects - akinesia, lack of movement
		- akathesia - restlessness, inability to sit still
		- **tardive** **dyskinesia**  = over months of use.... resistant to treatment after it develops - movements up the face like chewing , sucking in tongue . etc 
			- lip smacking , protrudng tongue
			- grmace
			- can't control this duh 
		- TREAT: with the anticholinergic drug coadministered with high potency gen 1 antipsychotics used 
			- recall dopamine and ach will play a balanced seesaw 
			- dopamine inhibits GABAergic proection of neurons from striatum 
			- ACH stimulates GABAergic projection of neurons from striatum 
			- when DA blocked, ACH activates these neurons causing EPS and motor symptoms 
		- Also TREAT w/ dopamine agonists 
			- amantadine for EPS potentiates release of dopamine, improve parkinsonism but temporariliy 
			- beta blockers too = propanolol for akathisia 
	- choreathetoid extremity movement - clonic jrking of finger/limbs/toes
	- additional SEs:
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">lower the seizure threshold!!!! both generations</mark>
		- QT prolongation like torsades de pointes
		- dementia -related psychosis !!!
		- sedation, orthostatic htn 
	- >neuroleptic malignant syndrome 
		- similar to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">malignant hyperthermia but precipitated by D2 antags and no strong gneetic component. leading to hyperactivity o the peripheral sympathetic NS</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hallmark = !!!!!!!!!!!!lead pipe muscle rigidity, mimicking severe parkinsons with coarse tremor + catatonia with elevation of serum creatine kinase... mental status stupor/delirium, and high fever + tachycardia</mark>
			- this happens days after initial therapy or dose escalation 
			- treat with dantrolene similar to malignant hyperthermia 
		- serotonin syndrome = serotonergic meds
		- antipsycotic meds = neurologic malignant syndrome
		- inhaled anesthetics = malignant hyperthermia! 

1st gen antipsychotics
- other drugs that cause same effects as these dopamine antags
- promethazine, prochlorperazine, metoclopramide 
- use of these unrelated can cause EPS 
- older, cheaper, work better on pos symptoms 
- higher anticholinergic
- more selectiv for D2 blockage
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">more potent at blocking D2 = more EPS experiencing!!!!</mark>
high to low potency 
1. haloperidol  = higher risk of getting EPS 
	1. high affinity D2 antag
	2. eps common but sedation/hypotension not much 
	3. most commonly used gen 1 
	4. metabolize by cyp2D6
	5. black box warning for IV .... bc of prolonged QTc leadng to torsades de pointes 
low potency 
- chlorpromazine 
	- lower risk of eps... low potency D2 antag
	- potention for severe hypotension 
	- VERY anticholinergic
	- risk of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">corneal + lenticular pigmentatin + deposits</mark>
	- metabolize by cyp2D6

2nd generation antipsychotics = atypical antipsychotics
- very expensive + newer
- may work on poz + neg symptoms 
- lower incidence of EPS, TD, NMS 
- but inc in metabolic syndrome stufff ): 
- thru 5-HT2A and D2 blockade primarily 
1. clozapine
	1. gold std, but not first prescried
	2. for refractory cases
	3. for treatment resistant failures with 2 fails first 
	4. weight gain common 
	5. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">risk of agranulocytosis + neutropenia!!! reqs weekly CBC</mark>
		1. severe infection with low neutrophils + sore throat with ulcers etc. 
	6. risk for seizures + hypotension, diabetes, increased ldl + triglycerides, sialorrhea 
	7. metabolized by cyp1A2 + cyp2d6 among others .... 
2. risperidone
	1. this is haloperiidol lite 
	2. lower potential for metabolic symptoms.... 
	3. one of the few which would <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">increase prolactin, leading to potential sex dysffunction</mark>
	4. cyp2d6 metabolized 
3. aripiprazole
	1. a d2 <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">partial agonitst, binding tightly but doesn't block it completely, allowing it to leak things thru still</mark>
	2. way less metabolic risk 
	3. high potential for akathisia  = inner restlessness foot tapping 
	4.  mid efficacy - used as an addon for many conditions 

4. olanzapine 
	1. high prob of weight gain!!!!!
	2. reportd as effetive but cardiometabolic risks migh be too much 
	3. used for bipolar depression 
	4. very sedating
5. quetiapine
	1. lower weight gain and stuff risk 
	2. goood efficacy 
	3. monotherapy for bipolar depression 
	4. sedating
	5. orthostatic hypotesnsion
