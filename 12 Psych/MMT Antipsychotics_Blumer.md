this is mainly a SE lecture - MOA are all similar. 
diff bt first gen + atypical antipsych = huge profile switch are done. 

poz symptoms of psychoses= most of the drugs treat these 
- delusions - fixed false beliefs not shared by others
- hallucinatns= perceptions disconnencted from external stimuli ... common auditory 
- illusions - severely distorted perceptions or misinterpretations of stimuli like seeing a pulsating obj 
- ideas of ref - ordinary objs have specific msgs for the person
- delusions of ref = person having beliefs can't question them 
- thought insertion/deletion = idea that outside agency removes or adds thoughts to their brain 
- disorg speech
- disorg behavior 
neg symptoms of psychoses = 2nd gen drugs are slightly better at treating these ): but ni general we don't have a lot 
- flattened/blunted affect
- amotivation
- asociality 
- alogia - poverty of speech 

target symptoms of this:
- cognitive deficits 
- pts with schizoprenia have basic sensori-motor skills + associative abilities but deficits in tasks that req symbolic or verbal representation 
- treat familiar associations as if they're unusual 
- deficits in working memory or scratch pad memory , holding goals, plans, etc 
indications for these antipsychotics
- schizophrenia, biplar dz, depression, autism, tourettes many uses!!!! 

psychosis = dopamine hypothesis 
- basically infers... that excessive dopamine activity is the cause underlying this ... 
- so classical D2 receptor blocking might alleviate poz symptoms of shcizophrenia 
- but all these drugs block D2 receptors.... but therapeutic benefit only seen after days-weeks
- however we might have other things than dopamine treating and or worsening psychoses. 
major dopamine pathways 
1. mesocortical/mesolimbic tracts
	1. projects from the VTA ventral tegmental area to prefrontal cortex, nigras accubens, and hippocampus extension 
	2. this is what we target to get rid of the poz symptoms 
	3. d2 receptors = we can't target fully to these areas so we block the D2 in the nigrostriatal tract + tuberinfundibular tract
2. nigrostriatal tract/extrapyramidal pathway
	1. from substantia nigra to dorsal striatum 
	2. modulates motor behavior 
	3. we get parkinsonian symptoms on these drugs, shuffling gait, tremors etc 
3. tuberoinfundibular tract 
	1. projects from arcuate nuc to the pituitary 
	2. dopamine inhibits prolactin secretions 
	3. so we would get prolactin release - causing sexual SEs like gyno etc..
4. serotnergic systems
	1. 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors are in the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">negative</mark> symptoms of schizophrenia 
	2. newer agent slike clozapine + risperidone have equal or greater affiniity for the 5-HT2A rec than the D2 rec 
	3. but antipsychotics that are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">atypical, having a high affinity antagonistic activity at the 5-HT2A receptors are more effective at treating negative symptoms than the clasical D2 receptor blockers while having fewer AE of motor origin. but not alone effective.</mark>
5- cliniical effects of antipsychotics
- reducing hallucination + paranoia 

1st gen antipsychotics


2nd generation antipsychotics
