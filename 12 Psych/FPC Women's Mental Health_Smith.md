womens health thru the life cycle 
NIH backed revitaliation act of 1993 - inclusion in research 
- ppl think it's unethical to study lactating women -  
- ppl aren't able to participate in vaccine trials. and then after open label ones 

pregnant women - a vulnerable population like prisoners and stuff 
- cannot provide inormed consent in this case 
- ssris - need pregnant ppl who tests it, would not recommend prescribing meds if not given to pregnant ppl previously 

very basic understanding of approach 

hormonal influence on mood
high risk perioids - big hormonal changes 

sensitivity to these expected hormonal shifts. 
menarche -> pms and pmdd 
- most have symptoms in week befoer have emotional/physical menstruation 
- pms is not in the dsm  
- pmdd requires mood charting for 2 menstrual cycles
- TREAT: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">b6</mark>, ocps, cbt, ssris and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">calcium</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">suppression</mark> 
- only treat with GnRH agonist should be only for most sevre or treatment resistent cases. 
	- surgical intervention only contemplated ater successful trial with GnRH
pms - 20-30%; <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">think more somatic symptoms for this</mark>
- dysfunction in social , academic or work performance... 1+ symptoms during 5 days prior to menses in 3 cycles
- releieved wthin 4 days onset of menses ; 
- affective
	- anger, anxiety, confusion, depression, irritability, social 
- somatic
	- abd bloating, breast tenderness, headache, joint pain , weight gain, muscle pain 
![[hormone cycle women.png]]

pmdd - <2% - screen for this due to relationship to postpartum depression - have to be emphatic ; think <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">more affective sypmtoms for this</mark>
- 5 symptoms + ooverall present be4 menstrual cycle and mood improves after onset
- 1+ of followng symptoms: 
	- decreased interest in usual activities (work, school friends, hobbies)
	- subjective dificulty in concentration 
	- lethargy 
	- change in appetite or cravings
	- hypersomnia or insomnia
	- sense of being out of contorl 
	- physical symptoms like breast tenderness/swelling/joint or muscle pain 
- 1+ of following: 
	- marked affective labiliity, marked irritability or anger or inc interpersonal conflicts
	- marked depression 
	- marked anxiety, tension or other on edge feelings 
- cause huge impairment, 2 cycle mood charting + not better explained by another disorder. 
RFs:
- alc, obesity, early sexual abuse/trauma hx, fam hx, tobacco

TREAT: 
- exercise, cbt b6, calcium up to 100 mg/day 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ssris, ocps.</mark>

PMS e = exasterbation - they have mood and depressviv issues most days but then during the pms phase it's clearly exacerbated wayyy more 


pmads = perinatal mood + anxiety disorders 
- first line tratment : ssris and brexanolone or zuranolone 
- no such thing as non-exposure in mental health in pregnancy.... <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">there's alrady increased risk in pregnancy - try to determine whether or not the med is warranted based on risk discusssion with pt, don't instruct them to stop j bc they're pregnant!!</mark>
- w/ inc severity of psych illness, we see inc risk of premature birth low birth weight, leading to inc anxiety, depression, adhd in kids
- w/ inc rates of suicide attampts, inc risk for mortality of both 
- inc risk of s/u - inc risk of exposure in utero, leading to disruptive behaviors in kids
- inc risk of relationship discrd -> less maternal support during pregnancy -> insecure attachment patterns 
perinatal mood disorders
- antenatal mood disordes
- baby blues
	- 80% of moms get this 
	- like acute stress disoorder vs ptsd 
	- short lasting/resolves without intervention 
	- doesn't interfere with daily activities
	- mood lability, tearfulness, anxiety, irritability 
	- huge hrmone shift, huge tiredness, difficulties iwth many other factors 
- peripartum depression 
	- same criteria as mdd
	- hx of perinatal depression, hsx of depression, moderate to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">severe PMDD or PMS</mark>
	- stressors
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">major depressive episode postpartum onset, in first 4 weeks or up to 12 months? certainly have a hormonal component to it</mark>
	- 50% of episodes start during pregnancy, and high number 1 in 7 ppl have it 
	- medical issues = thyroid imbalence or women with any diabetes
	- ob/neonatal = mother of multiples, mom whose infants are in nicu , complications in birth/breastfeeding or preganncy
	- TREAT: 
		- psychotherapy, cbt, interpersonal psychotherapy 
		- sleep, exercise, yoga , mindfulness 
		- for moderate - severe depression 
			- SSRI, SNRI, 
			- allopregnanolone - 
				- poz allosteric mod of GABA A receptor, inc inhibitory transmission but excesisve sedaton 
				- involvement in days 
				- insurance approval costly 
			- brexanolone taken off market = just for this type of depression, which is too expensive 
				- happens in days 
				- continuous infusion 
				- inpatient 
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">zuranolone = working well specifically made for pregnancy group! but still expensive</mark>
				- outpatient, 2 wk course 
- postpartum psychosis - presumed to be bipolar unless proved otherwise ; 
	- psychiatric emergency 
	- rapid onset , first pregnancy 
	- not overly psychotic can look like delrium 
	- suspect bipolar, 4% suicie/infanticie risk R
	- RFs: prior episodes of psychosis, perosnal fm hx of bpolar 
	- sleep loss 
	- TREAT: lithium!! 

perinatal anxiety disorders
- anxiety
- panic
- obsessive compulsive disorder
	- common but they're scared to say so unless we ask
	- prevalence is higher in first time moms 
	- intrusive thoughts are very debilitating, center around a theme in postpartum ocd these revolve aoruond their baby 
	- thoguths are about harming hteir baby with no intent or desire to do so 
	- diff from psychotic orhomicidal thoughts
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dystonic = thoughts that aren't in line with who we are or what we believe</mark>
- ptsd 
mental health is most common copmlication of pregnancy + childbirth 
- we screen but don't know how to really treat. afraid of treating pregnant women bc medications are not seen as something that's safe for them. 
- suicide/od is the number one cause of death pregnancy related. 
- even worse for black and indigenous women. 
- arresting pregnant women for drug usage isn't helpful 
- criminalized su during pregnancy but we prefer to have open and honest talks with ppl... they fear too much of being arrested. 
- fentanyl is really the biggest issue with this. 
- the most risky part of postpartum for death is late postpartum perioid of death and overdose 
- TREAT: suboxone or buprenorphine very effective in care + methadone too 

what meds should i choose?
- things will change 
- what's likely to wrk - like ssris 
	- has smeone been on something in the past that worked well ? 
- what are the ses?
- what are the data we have for each thing 
	- use it as the deicison making process but it's not the only one obviously 
- what does data tell us abt each option 
- what's their preference 
	- super prevalent. 
	- provide psycheducation, tey're not gonna take a med they don't agree with anyways 


perimenopause

we get vaginal dryness, cog changes with deprssed mood, hot flashses, urinary problems, mood instability, sleep disturbances tooo
