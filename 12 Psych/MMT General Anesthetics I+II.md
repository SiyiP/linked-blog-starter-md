this is interesting area of pharm bc 
- specific moa - unsolved still 
- real time management
- volatile ones have high efficacy but low potency, steep dose-response curves with low therapeutic indices 

pharm actions of these anesthetics
- paralysis - immobility to noxious stimuli
- amnesia with unconsciousness
- analgesia
- sedation/anxiolysis 

bc of the hazards we need monitoring, special equipment, trained personnel, etc. 
- intubation / endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway is required
- feet above head, large habitus, and lacroscopic cases they're intubated. this is a clinical base to base scenario
- very steep dose response curves with no antags = very dangerous 
- we always use combinations of drugs

we need to get to stage 3 surgical anesthesia asap... 
- stage 1 and 2 are analgesia, excitement/delirium with risk of laryngospasm and hyperreactive...
- stage 3 = surgical what we expect
- and we don't wanna give too much to stage 4, which is medullary depression = loss of respiration + vasomotor control+death 
ideal gen anesthetic = achieved only by a coombination of anesthetics. 
- amnesia
- analgesia
- unconsciousness
- muscle relax
- reduce reflex
- quick acting and rapidly elim 

moa theroies 
- inhalted gases would be induced by partitioning itself in the membrane and then impact ion movement thru the channels bc they're strongly lipophillic, partitioning very well 
- more correct - they bind to specific sites and specific receptors 
	- like the GABA A receptors!!! for one example 
	- conduction of more Cl- ions with more and more 
	- this anesthetic will bind to specific binding site on that gaba A but we don't really know 

typical prog of general anesthesia = key is having patient hx 
1. sedation  = reduce anxiety , pre op patient management 
	1. facilitating msooth + rapid induction 
2. induction = sedation + rapid loss of consciousness 
3. paralysis = intubation, muscle relaxants, 
4. maintenance with gas = volatile liquids, will maintain our thing after our IV induction dose 


anxiolytics 
1. midazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for this purpose! 
	1. and diazepam lorazepam too 
	2. given to facilitate actions of GABA on GABA A receptor acting as poz allosteric modulator, inc the freq of channel opening + potency of GABA but not the channel directly 
	3. min CV depressant effects, but respiratory deppressant 
	4. anterograde **amnesia** 
	5. reverse with flumazenil 
2. induction! rapid loss of consciousness  = a cocktail 
	1. IV nduction is more pleasant and safe
	2. but some ppl have mask inductions/inhalational ones - takes a bit longer
	3. inducing it via:
	4. barbiturates
		1. primarily thiopental ; veryyy lipophillic + fast acting 
		2. reflex tachy and dose dependent drop in bp. 
		3. facilitates actions of GABA on GABA A , inc potency, time opened for the channel, AND maximal affect of GABA 
		4. rapid onset of action but less rapid in elim, causing hangovers. causes n/v 
		5. resp depressant ; need to support their respiration 
	5. propofol  -!!!!!!most common induction agent 
		1. the milky white substance emulsion; check for egg allergies + be careful to use it immediately bc the emulsion supports bacterial growth ;  given with lidocain to prevent pain on injecton due to this emulsion 
		2. lipophillic AF
		3. enhances GABA on GABA A receptor 
		4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dramatic dec in BP, SVR, contractility, impairs barofeflex response to hypotension and can be severe in pts</mark>
		5. respiratory depression support their respiration 
		6. anticonvulsant properties too! and antiemetic too is great 
		7. high lipid solubility results in onset of action rapidly but recovery is better due to quick clearance. 
	6. etomidate - MOST MINIMAL effects on CV!!! for patients who you're worried about  
		1. depresses reticular activating system + increases affinity of GABA the GABA A receptor
		2. less resp depression than propofol 
		3. dec cranial blood flow + ICP 
		4. short half life but not use for long cases 
		5. but causes <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">adrenocortical suppression = basically 11b-hydroxylase which converts 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol will be inhibited</mark>
			1. we can't use it for too long., they need to have a stress repsonse to surgery 
			2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">may need to add some drug to make sure adrenals recover = hydrocortisone!!</mark> for post op 
		6. myoclonus during induction - may not be for ppl with hx of seizures. 
	7. ketamine - NMDA receptor antagonist
		1. will block polysynaptic reflexes in spinal cord
		2. analgesic effect in contrast to rest of induction drugs = for very short painful procedures like burn changes 
		3. dissociative anesthesia - appears to be conscious via nystagmus but can't respond to sensory input 
		4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inc bp, hr, co in contrast to other agents</mark>
			helping ppl with acute hypovol shock + avoid in ppl with HTN/CAD
		5. IM administration for peds 
		6. inc salivation so avoid in bronchostuff 
		7. avoid in pts with ptsd 
conscious sedation = sedate them but they remain conscious, coorperative responsive with intact airway and reflexes
- huge for patients who don't have a lot of anxiety fear phobia or otherwise for brief but unpleasant procedures like endoscopy 
- common combo = midazolam/fentanyl or propofol/fentanyl 
3. paralysis for intubation/muscle relaxation 
	1. give a paralytic
	2. fentanyl ahead of that to suppress any other reflexes + analgesic
	3. abolish the snses to facilitate intubation!! provide muscle relaxation 
	4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">blockage  of nicotinic ach receptors in the nmj</mark>
	5. these are not alone to suppress hemodynamic responses to painful stimuli... opioids are used prior to intubation for this reason like fentanyl or meperidine 
4. maintenance with gas - these are like liquis which give off gas 
	1. very dangerous - steep dose response curves etc
	2. NO = nitrous oxide
	3. halogenated hydrocarbons like chloroform + halothane 
	4. a bunch of volatile agents would be vaporized to dial in how much u want and then the flow meters would then waft it thru the hose into the patient and then they'll breahte it in and exhale 
	5. monitoring it all via a circuit 
	6. gradient is a partial pressure gradient!!!! 
	7. some gases have higher solubility for blood = which is a reservoir for the gas to be stored in 
	8. when enough gases are in your blood only then will they move to the CNS 
	9. delivered concentration with partial pressure -> into the patient inspired concentration -> into the lungs -> concentration into the blood -> into the brain!!! 
		1. over time, the amount inspired and amt in the patient lungs are the same, but the difference is in alveolar partial pressure!!!
		2. alveolar partial pressure = goverens partial pressure of anesthetic in ALL TISSUES since they ultimately equal the alveolar partial pressure of the gas at equilibrium 
		3. PA (partial pressure between allveoli) = Pa = P br (partial pressure in brain)
		4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">alveolar partial pressure is a direct readout of what is in the CNS</mark>
		5. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">amount of anesthetic in the system - uptake from the alveoli into the blood and other parts of the body</mark>

drugs absorbed from the solution: 
equilibrium with equal concentrations on both sides 
dissolved drug in the GI will equilibriate across the membrane barrier into dissovled drug of the blood 

but in the gas phase... 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">drugs partition according to their partial pressure instead.... and equilibrium is reached with partial pressures are equal on both sides and there's no net transfer of anesthetic from one to another... but the concentrations on both side can be different</mark>
equilibrium is across membrane barrier between the alveolar space and blood 
- partial pressure same
- not the concentration 
- if anesthetic gas is achieved equilibrium.... 
	- p1 = P2 
	- more concentrated into the blood!!!
	- you must fill up that blood , which will have higher affinity to the anesthetic vs the gas phase 
	- u need to fill it up so it can have enough partial pressure to eventually be pushed into the CNS 
	- when u have <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anesthetic gases that are HIGHLY Soluble in BLOOD, INDUCTION IS SLOWED!!!</mark>
		- high solubility is bad... bc that means u gotta fill up the blood with a lot of particles just cause it can absorb so much in order for it to go to the brain eventually 
		- ![[anesthetic partial pressures.png|190x281]]
	- solubility will also slow recovery 
	- uptake of the anesthetic (body holding onto it) also has an effect on slower recovery from that anesthetic 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">poorly blood soluble anesthetic. = volatile inhaled gases</mark> = they will work faster + awake faster!!!!

rapid rise in the beginning + the equilibrium. 
- basically. the Fa/Fi ratio = fractional amount in ppl's lungs, 
- will have each curve rise quickly and then plateau. 
- the curves for each drug differ in position but stays same in shape ![[Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 6.00.06 AM.png]]
- inflow of anesthetic gas to the alveoli
	- ventilation = inc this = faster induction 
	- concentration 
		- with having more fast effect due to concentration being higher, this is like an iv bolus/loading dose
why does it go up so rapidly ? 
- FA/FI ratio = rapidly changes if effect of ventilation VA is unopposed. 
- 1 breath/min = 4 L / 2L (FRC) + 4L) = .67
- basically if u breathe an anesthetic gas, breathing in and out multiple times, you get more and more gas in your system 
- whats opposing this rise ? -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">solubility.</mark> / uptake 
	- the difference in whats going in vs whats coming out, and the reason for the delta = the solubility, that anesthetic's getting absorbed elsewhere 

function: 
lambda = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">blood gas partition coeffficient, a function of blood solubility = delta</mark>, at equilibium, how much of the drug in the blood phase vs the gas phase !!!!! blood solubility !!!! = lambda 
lambda x CO x A-v = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">uptake</mark>
	basically if halothane lambda = 2.4, means at eq, concentration of halothane in blood is 2.4x higher than concentration in alveoli
		high blood solubility = high lambda = high lipid solubility = low speed of induction 
- cardiac output 
	- not super important but higher CO = slower induction bc this would remove more anesthetic from alveoli 
- A-v = alveolar to venous partial pressure 
	- higher the diff in anesthtic concentration bt alveolar or arterial blood to venous blood the higher the uptake therefore slower induction 
	- reflects uptake by the tissues. based on 
		- solubility of gas in tissue (high lipid solubility too = slower)
shapes of curves are all the same bc the equilium is more of a body part specific thing too thing. 
![[Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 6.09.38 AM.png]]

how are inhalational anesthtics measured?? 
- exact concentration of this is hard to measure = the MAC value is used or the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">minimal alveolar concentration</mark>
- how much to prevent the muscular response to a std painful stimulus in **50% unparalyzed ppl**? 
- inversely related to lipid solubility, so it's <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">small in potent anesthetics like halothane and large for less potent ones for NO</mark>
- slower induction, = highly lipophillic like halothane, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">means u need less for it!!!</mark>
you can take the mac values and then x by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">1.3 = ED95, the amoutn to put 95% of pateitns to sleep</mark>
this ishow u try to adjust the number to monitor the patient during surgery 
u can take a half MAc of NO and half mac of halothane and then find a new MAC from that. 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">these MACs are ADDITIVE bc these functions are the same!!!</mark> 

functions that alter MAC
- thing that inc mac= make them less sensitive 
	- hyprerthermia greater than 42 C 
	- inc CNS catecholamines
	- CNS sodium 
	- CHRONIC etoh abuse 
- thing that dec mac/make patient more sensitvie
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inc age</mark>
	- hyppothermia
	- pregnancy
	- sepsis
	- acute ethanol intx 
	- and anesthetic drugs like opioids etc local anesthetics and N2O 
	- also a2 adrenergic receptor agonists like dexmedetomidine 
- no change - duration of anesthetsia, gender, height/weight 

inhalational 
1. NO - sweetsmelling, MAC high so you can't use it high concentrations
	1. low solubility rapid onset
	2. profound analgesia used at 30-50 
	3. not muscle relaxants
	4. indications =for anxiety / phobia , conscious sedation 
	5. effects are additive, reducing the amts of total agents required to achieve stage.3 
	6. CI : resp obstruction + COPD, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pneumothorax - this nitrogen will move into that compartment and really expand that wall.</mark>, pregnancy + chrnic ear stuff... 
	7. post op n/v is huge but htis will be rpidly inhibited
	8. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">like B12  enzyme inhition with chronic use of this like neuropathys, ataxia/muscl weakness, megaloblastic anemia, </mark> inc risk of spontaneous abortion 
	9. **diffusion hypoxia**
		1. when the n2o stop and then the pt breaths the romo air 
		2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">all that N2O goes into the alveoli from the blood, diluting subsequent breaths of o2 and then they become hypoxic</mark>
		3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">we NEED to give 100% o2 for 3-5 min at the end of procedure to prevent this!</mark>

all volatile anesthetics are triggers for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">malignant hyperthermia!! MH</mark>
- genetic cmponents? = polymorphisms of **ryanodine receptor** + succynlcholine triggrs this too 
- **fatal hypermetabolic dz** = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">arrhythmias, metabolic + respiratoory acidosis, inc HR, hyperkalemia + hyperthermia</mark>
	- presents in intraop periood 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inc in intracellular calcium causes all those things listed above.</mark>
	- give dantrolene for this!!! 
all these anesthetics causee dose dependent dec in BP and SVR except halothane .... 
- these are seen during **induction** during maintenannce 
- all moderate **bronchodilators** + s**keletal muscle relaxant**s + resp depressaants 
- primarily elim by ventilaton  = we NEED to support their respiration 
1. note about HALOTHANE
	potent bronchodilator, dec bp and blunts baroreceptor reflex
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sensitizes heart to catecholamine induced arrhythmias + hepatic toxicity due t oimmune response to hepatic proteins that get trifluoroaceylated from metabolism. = hepatitis</mark>
	-  low pungency allowing for inhalational induction in pediatric cases 
2. isofluorane - new improved halothane 
	1. gross odor - not used inhalationally 
	2. no hepatic + renal toxicity 
	3. higher blood solubility than others, typically oonly used when cost is a factor 
3. desflurane  
	1. **very rapid onset + recovery, low blood solubility, lowest lambda** 
	2. pungent odor = can't use in mask inducton, stimulates resp reflexes liek coughing!!
	3. expensive, global warming ): 
4. sevoflurane = improved desflurane! 
	1. very rapid onset + recovery 
	2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">low pungency, less bronchospamss, useful for inhalational / mask induction esp for pediatric patients</mark>
