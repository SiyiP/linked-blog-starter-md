| Working memory is essential for temporarily holding and manipulating information needed for cognitive tasks such as reasoning, learning, and comprehension. It allows us to keep information in mind while using it to perform tasks like solving problems, making decisions, and understanding language. |     |
**  
Non-Associative Learning:** This type of learning involves changes in the strength of response to a single stimulus due to repeated exposure. It includes two main types: habituation and sensitization.

- **Habituation:** This is when a person becomes less responsive to a stimulus after repeated exposure. For example, becoming less responsive to a loud noise over time is a classic example of habituation.

|This type of learning involves behavior being influenced by the consequences that follow it. In this scenario, the student's behavior (studying hard) is reinforced by positive outcomes (praise and good grades), which increases the likelihood of the behavior being repeated. This is a clear example of operant conditioning, where rewards or punishments shape behavior.|   |

He was unable to remember events that happened to him, such as vacations or personal milestones. Despite his episodic memory impairment, K.C.'s semantic memory remained intact.

It helps individuals change thoughts and behaviors that negatively impact sleep, promoting healthier sleep patterns without the side effects associated with medications. |     |

medication overuse headache (MOH), characterized by:

- Headaches present >15 days/month

- Regular use of acute headache medications

- Development over 3 months

- Improvement within 2 months of medication withdrawal

The first step in managing MOH is to discontinue the overused medication. While prophylactic medications may eventually be needed, they are less effective until medication overuse is addressed. Sumatriptan could worsen the cycle of medication overuse. Lumbar puncture and prednisone are not indicated without other concerning symptoms.

  
C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are the most sensitive laboratory markers for temporal arteritis. They are elevated in >90% of cases and are used to:

- Support the initial diagnosis

- Monitor disease activity

- Guide treatment decisions

    Methamphetamine intoxication presents with hallucinations, delusions, pupillary dilation, impaired judgement, and increased energy and alertness.
- Cocaine intoxication presents with pupillary dilation, hallucinations, paranoia, increased energy, and potential sudden cardiac death.

- Marijuana intoxication presents with euphoria, increased appetite, impaired judgement, paranoid delusions, dry mouth, and conjunctival injection.

    Evaluating a proverb would involve abstraction. This can also be assessed by asking if a patient can determine what two objects have in common. Abstraction testing is a part of the cognitive performance during the mental status evaluation.
- During a mental status examination, cognition is assessed. The components of cognition typically assessed are alertness, orientation, attention/concentration, memory, and abstract reasoning.
- Congruent affect refers to if the affect matches the patient's described mood. Incongruent affect is if the affect does not match the patient's described mood.
- Appropriateness of affect is whether the patient's affect fits with their current situation. This is described as either appropriate or inappropriate.

    Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that involves restricted intake, weight loss, metabolic and physiologic changes, and altered body image.
- Many of the symptoms of anorexia nervosa may overlap with those of bulimia nervosa. However, those with anorexia are always underweight, and those with bulimia typically have a normal or slightly increased BMI.

    While an individual with social anxiety disorder may worry about being around **unfamiliar** people rather than people that they are close to, diagnosis requires **marked fear or anxiety in which they are the exposed to possible scrutiny by others.** In separation anxiety disorder the key feature is persistent and excessive fear or anxiety about **harm to attachment figures, loss or separation from attachment figures.**
- Social anxiety disorder is characterized by marked or intense fear or anxiety of social situations in which they could be the **subject of scrutiny.** Such situations include doing something in public where they could be under scrutiny, such as speaking or eating in a public place. The individual fears that he or she may behave in a manner that will be negatively evaluated or lead to their being embarrassed, rejected, humiliated or offending others. These situations always provoke fear or anxiety and avoided or endured with intense fear and anxiety.

- REM sleep behavior disorder is characterized by complex motor actions that occur during REM sleep. Dream enactment can occur.
- The motor behavior generally occurs during the latter part of the night. The patient may not recall their actions but may recall their dreams.
- These behaviors may be prodromal signs of neurodegeneration, like in patients with Parkinson's disease.
- Nightmare disorder also involves recalling dreams, but motor behaviors and sleep-related injuries are not seen.

|Lewy body dementia is distinguished by recurrent <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">visual hallucinations, fluctuating attention</mark>, and parkinsonian motor symptoms. 

Alzheimer's disease typically begins with memory impairment and lacks prominent hallucinations early in the course.|   |

Vascular NCD often follows cerebrovascular events and presents with stepwise or fluctuating decline, executive dysfunction, and slowed processing. 

Alzheimer's disease is more associated with memory impairment. 

Frontotemporal NCD involves personality and language changes. 

Lewy body dementia includes hallucinations and parkinsonism.
