|   |   |
|---|---|
|Lewy body dementia is distinguished by recurrent <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">visual hallucinations, fluctuating attention</mark>, and parkinsonian motor symptoms. 

Alzheimer's disease typically begins with memory impairment and lacks prominent hallucinations early in the course.|   |

Vascular NCD often follows cerebrovascular events and presents with stepwise or fluctuating decline, executive dysfunction, and slowed processing. 

Alzheimer's disease is more associated with memory impairment. 

Frontotemporal NCD involves personality and language changes. 

Lewy body dementia includes hallucinations and parkinsonism.
