case
19 yo male -> into office, over 6 mon, isolating, not groomngk, failing out 
- flat affect, paranoid, poor grooming
- grandma died.1 yr ago 
- concern about depression 

psychosis 
- pos symptoms
	- delusions
		- fixed false belief not based in reality 
		- often paranoid 
		- im some singer named ludiris 
	- hallucinations
		- sensations + perceptions that aren't reall ythere
		- most ofen voices others don't hear 
		- hypnagogic= see something when u go sleep "gog, going to sleep"
		- hypnopompic  = as you wake up 
		- other senses have nonpsych causs unless proven otherwise 
	- disorg speech 
		- outside of cultural norm - like sometimes it's part of culture 
		- echolalia = patient repeats what you say 
		- echo apraxia - copies what you do 
		- neologisms - words made up with special meaning; brand new word with a special meaning  
	- disorganized
		- 
neg. =
- flat affect, poor grooming/hygiene, amotivation 
- amotivation - lack of initiative for adls
- alogia = paucity of speech, thought blockng 
- asocial - isolation 
- affect blunted 


differential 
- schizophrenia/schizophreniform, brief psychotic disorder
	- criteria - 2 more of this following: 
	- delusions
	- hallucinations
	- disorg speech/behavior
	- negative symptoms 
	- must have at least one of - delusions, hallucinations, disorg speech 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">symptoms last 6+ mon or more </mark>
	- hallucinations typically auditory. 
	- tactile hallucinations might suggest sud and withdrawals instead 
	- or smelling burnt rubber. - think seizures first. 
	- equal gender distribution 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">age onset 18-35 ; age of onset is huge! men usually early 20s, women late 20s </mark>
	- course <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">chronic and unremitting in industrialized countries + acute and episodic in developing countries</mark>.
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">good prognostic factors</mark> - good premorbid functioning, abrupt onset, fam hx of mood disorder 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">poor prognostic factors </mark>= early onset, fam hx of psychosis, gradula onset 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">decreased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is associated with impaired exec functionig/working memb</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">abnormal prefrontal cortex function</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hypofrontality in left inf frontal gyrus with poor social cognition</mark>
			second-gen antipsychotics might correct this 
		- significant cognitive dysfunction 
		- can even appear mentally r-tarded after several years with the disease ): 
		- and socially if u get it at 18, they socially stay at 18. 
		- patients dev stops and regresses when they get sick 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">schizophrenic pts often use nicotine bc nicotine helps with concentration </mark>-> think of this being a stimulant 
	- auditory cortex dysfunction associated with auditory hallucination seen in mri 
- molecular biology 
	- suscpetibility to genetics 
	- genotype then -> stressors and stuff moe and more push them over the edge with neurochemistry ... or maybe viruses of the pregnant woman, or some sort of multiple hits. or pandas with ocd, strep causing ocd symptoms in kid 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">note - we get larger ventricles and cortical wasting aftr a while, smaller thalamus too!!!!!!</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dopamine plays a biggest role</mark>
		- dopamine is bining to this stuff, 20% of dopa receptors are bound at baseline compared to just 10% 
		- can induce psychosis with cocaine or lsd or something - giving dopamine products cause psychosis 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">and blocking dopamine will stop psychotic symptms</mark>
	1. nigrostriatal tract - extrapyramidal pathway starts in the substantia nigra and ends in caudate nuc + putamen of basal ganglia 
		1. tends to be with movement 
	2. mesolimbic tract - from midbrain tegmentum + innervates nucleus accumbens + adjacent limbic structures 
		1. think poz symptoms of schizophrenia 
	3. mesocrotical tract- from midgran tegmentum + innervates ant cortical areas 
		1. some positive and **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">negative</mark>** symptoms
	4. tuberoinfundibular tract - projects from arcuate + periventrcular nuclei of the hypothalamus to the pituiatry 
		1. affects the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">prolactin</mark> 
cell bodies 
- ach nucleus basalis of meynert = in the basal forebrain, in substantia innominata of basal forebrain ; **alzheimers** 
- serotonin = raphe nuclei- clusters that would release this , along the midline of the brainstem ; **OCD** 
- NE = locus ceruleus ; P**anic disorder** 
- substantia nigra = **dopamine** 

antipsychotic effects= think about all the pathways we block!!! 
 - in a perfect world we would just block the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways ... 
- EPS se
	- dystonia, parkinsonism(nigrostriatal), akathisia, tardive dyskinesia
- endocine changes(tuberoinfundibular)
	- prolactin elevation, glactorrhea, gynecmastia, menstrual changes , sexual dysfunction 

we have to block 65% of receptors for them to get better, efficacy 
80% blocked is correlated with EPS = extrapyramidal symptoms 
- shorter time of d2 receptor occupancy = lower eps. 


- schizophreniform disorder
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">duration of 1-6 mons </mark>
	- same symptoms same prognosis 

- brief psychotic disorder 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">only 1-30 days </mark>
	- same syptoms of schizophrenia 
	- just goes away for no reason 

- delusional disorder
	- just false beliefs or delusions that last 1+ month
	- fairly well encapsulated
	- fuctioning not significantly impaired
	- types
		- erotomanic
		- graniose
		- jealous
		- persecutary ,
		- somatic 
		- mixed
- schizoafective disorder - SAFD
	- chronic psychosis all the time, but long perioids of depression or mania 
	- affective. = mood
	- one bout of depression + schizophrenia it's just unspecified
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">chronic mood is key too</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">they have to have had period in past where pt is only psychotic for 2 weeks</mark>
		- these ppl have psychosis regardless , it doesn't go away when treating their depression and still stays 
	- depressed type 
	- bipolar type = if they've evre been manic 
	- treat: antipsychotic + antidepressant or mood sabilizaer. 

- with bipolar disorder or major depression 
	- indistinguishable psychotic symptoms can happen 
	- but mania/depression predominate
	- can have <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">mod congruent hallucinations and when mania/depression resolve, so does psychosis</mark>
	- mood congruent hallucinations/delusions
		- delusion or voice hearing consistent with mood disruption 
		- like you should kys a voice
		- or pt bleleives she's dead already 

- schizotypal or paranoid personality disorders
	- familial link to schizophrenia 
	- antipsychotics can reduce sypmtoms+improve cognition 
	- but these schizotypal patients are eccentric/unusual or guarded but not psychotic blantantly usually 

to treat schizophrenia + other disorders
- think moostly antipsychotics 
- thioridazine... -zines
- atypical - aripiprazole is a huge thing, and clozapine, -pines, and -peridones 
- 

other mimicers 
- sud and or withdrawal
- mdd , bpad
- dementia
- delusional disorder
- shared psychotic disorder
- psychosis secondary to a medical condition
- normal - cultural/bereavement 
- delirium 
- if it's late or early onset, think organic or other things 

step 1 pearls
- nonspcific in schizophrenia - ct of head = enlarged ventricles
- know protoypes 
- basic ses of eps/td and there's cholinergic tone on dopamine neurons 
- basal ganglia = extrapyramidal symptoms 
- risperidone = treat psychotisisk, blocks the d2, 5ht2 receptors 

neuroleptic malignant syndrome = rare life threatening rxn to antipsychotic. - fever, severe muscle rigidity, mental status and autonomic instability due to da blockage in brain 

parkinsonian syndromes - treated with diphenhydramine benadryl or something else 

propanolol given for =  akathisia - but it's usually due to antipsychotics
