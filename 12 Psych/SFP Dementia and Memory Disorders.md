episodic memb - memb of autobiographical events
- more of the medial temporal lobes 

other types o f memory 
- procedural - new motor skills
- knowledge of world = semantic , this is like inferolateral temporal and anterior temporal lobes 
case 1: 
1. progressive episodic memory loss
	1. forgetting convos, repeating sstatements, gets lost while dirving
	2. normal gen neuro exams
	3. thinking of medial temporal lobes 
	4. next step : mental status exam 
		1. alterness/orientation = observed , oriented to today being monday, etc. orientation is a memory test (short term episodic memory)
			1. observation,
			2. person place time situation 
		2. attention 
			1. serial 7 sutractions
			2. spell backwards
			3. phone number
		3. language
			1. fluency/comprehension 
			2. repetiton/naming
			3. writing/reading
		4. memory 
			1. 3 word delayed recall 
		5. visual spatial 
			1. copy figure 
		6. executive 
			1. clock draw + trails 
	5. can also assess wiht MMSE = mini mental state exam = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">good to follow</mark>
	6. montreal cog assessment or MOCA is huge too 

pathology = these all have many causes 
1. dementia = DSM IV (can be caused by alzeimers but not everyone with this can have alzheimers)
	1. multiple cognitive deficits <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">OBJECTIVE</mark> which include memory PLUS
		1. aphasia
		2. apraxia
		3. agnosia
		4. exec dysfunction 
	2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">social of occupational function is also impaired!!!</mark>
	3. this has normal lvl of alertness unlike delirium 
	4. progressive + irreversible
	5. not a dx by itself but a description of symptoms = workup required. 
2. **major** neurocognitive disorder
	1. significant cog decline in one or more domain 
		1. with concern by patient or informant
		2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">obj cognitive assessment</mark> of at least one domain 
		3. interference with independence in everyday activities
		4. diff etiologic subtypes 
	2. this is a new term for dementia!! 
		1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the instrumental ADLs are impacted SPECIFICALLY!!!!!!!!!</mark>
		2. if it were BADLS too == this means it's progressed to severity!!!
3. mild neurocognitive disorder
	1. have objective impairment but still doing day to day tasks
	2. instrumental  asks of daily living IADLS = ability to shop, maangement of money, meds still are there 
	3. badls = basic acts of living, dressing up, showering, feeding self still can be done 

cognitive symptoms due to depression = "pseudodementia"
4. delirium = encephalopathy 
	1. fluctuating lvl of alertness
	2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">acute and reversible dysfunction related to mainly non-brain issues</mark>
	3. like sepsis, toxic-metabolic issues
	4. inability to pay attention 
	5. multifocal brain lesions like vsaculitis
	6. diffuse primary CNS problems

causes of dementia/cog impairment 
![[causes of dementia + cog impairment.png]]

when someone has <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">objective</mark> showing of cog impairment = we need brain imging
- mri brain = preferred  to rule out strokes, tumors, hydrocephalus (if all ruled out , probalby degeenative)
- CT scan mainly if you're in the ER 
LABS
- thyroid, b12, sypillis antibody 
review meds
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anticholinergics + sedatives</mark>
consider referral 
- neuro + neuropsych 
- assess for sleep apnea too, if ur brain doesn't get a lot of sleep u get craay 

if someone's 65+ age, u are more likely to have alzheimers be the most common cause of dementia 
1. alzheimers dz
	1. neurodegen
	2. amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles tau 
	3. hippocamps -> temporal lobe -> parietal lobe => frontal lobe 
	4. thoughts that amyloid first then the tau is more extreme 
	5. RFs
		1. age, fam hx, head trauma, female sex, down syndrome (related to amyloid precursor being on chromosome 21)
		2. not a pure genetic dz tho esp when developped 65+ age 
	6. the alz spectrum .... 
		1. amyloid and tau will build up to 20 years before we see symptoms. 
		2. when the protein biomarkers are positive... they start well be4 symptoms 
2. if someone has <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">mild cognitive impairment and normal biomarkers, they have a 5% 3 yr progression until u get alz disease</mark>
3. if u don't tst anything, u have 10-15% chance per year to progress to dementia!!
	1. so please do biomarker tests! 
4. but the risk with biomarkers
	1. most ppl don't have alz. there's many other things that will cause poz readings even tho it has nothing to do with any symptoms 
	2. clinical hx mst important thing. 

FDG pet = how much sugar is each part off brain using? 
- alz = hypometabolism in temporal parietal areas. 
- only used to differentiate bt frontotemporal dementia + alz disease 

amyloid PET = a biomarker test 
- amyloid tracer = dark tracer will be in the white matter of the brain, a lot more near the middle
- poz/bad readings will show dark gray all thruout the cortex 


CSF = 
- amyloid beta 4.2 
- aBeta
- as accurate to the amyloid pet, pretty good 
blood tests 
- not as good
- pTau measure 

treat: 
- mild cognitive impairment/alz dz 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">antiamyloid monoclonal antibodies will slow progression of disease</mark>
		- lecanemab, donanemab 
		- given in mmild cognitive impairment stage
		- - amyloid related imging abnormalities - for severe risk for this !!! side effect. swelling seen in the brain 
	- cholinesterase inhibitors = helping with some meory funtion 
	- memantine dz = moderate to severe AD 
		- this is NMDA receptor antagonist 
- notE: there is no approved treatments for non-alz dz mild cog impairment. 
	- just cognitive exercise + phys exercise + offer trials. 

---
frontal lobe - ability to inhibit yourself 
prefrontal cortex = exec function + behavior 
1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia</mark> = slowly progressive change in PERSONALITY
	1. like 10-15% 
	2. disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy 
	3. looks psychiatric at first 
	4. develop deficits in exec function with memory + visuospatial skills relatively spared 
	5. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pick's disease tau inclusions? heterogenous pathology usually and TDP43 in brain too</mark>
	6. younger ppl onset usually 50 year olds 
		1. parkinsonium 
		2. ALS
	7. primary progressive aphasia variants too 
2. vascular dementia - severe white matter dz 
	1. multi infarct vascular dementia - seen more = having a stroke and more strokes, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">stepwise decline!</mark>
	2. most of the time we see slowly progressive change in exec function, apathy, more irritability 
	3. severe white matter dz = like <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">unctonroled htn all your life</mark>
	4. strategic infarc of anterior thalamus 
	5. subcortcal subtype tooo 
	6. this can also be a mild cognitive impairment too if mild enough 
	7. if it does get worse tho it's then called vascular dementia
3. dementia with lewy bodies
	1. cousin of parkinsons; starting out with the cog deficits 
	2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">instead of lewy bodies being in basal ganglia + substantia nigra(PD) the lewy bodies are diffuse and cortical!!!!</mark>
	3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">visual hallucinationS!!!!</mark>
	4. fluctuating cognition
	5. in classic parkinsonium disorder fashion you have REM sleep behavior disorder where you act out dreams! 
	6. TREAT: cholinesterase inhibitors for cognition/hallucinations. levodopa/carbidopa for movements 
	7. avoid antipsychotics 
4. parkinson's dz dementia 
	1. where someone has PD and then eventually get dementia
