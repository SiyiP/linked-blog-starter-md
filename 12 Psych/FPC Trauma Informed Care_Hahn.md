black yuoth. 5 racial discrim per day 
intersectionality + barriers they face in systems 

truama prevalence in primary care
- nearly half 3+ potentally traumatic events

the body keeps the score = they are going to lean on the medical system way more 

effects "ABCs framework"
- affect

- social - being around ppl but feeling cut offf from the people or not feeling love for them 
- school/work 
higher risk of gettin gptsd
- higher rates for intentional trauma 37.1 in ptsd in year

symptoms of ptsd - dsm 5
- criterian A = stressor 
- criterian b = intrusion!! invol, recurrent distressing memories, flashbacks, pmarked reacitivyt to cues 
- c = avoidance = persistant, effortful avoidance of thoughts, feeligns, ext reminders
- d = negative laterations in cognitions + mood

primary care screener
in the past month have u 
1. had nightmares or thought about it when u did not want to 
2. tried hard not to think abt the events or went out of ur way to avoid situations which reminded u 
3. been constantly on guard, watchful or ez startled
4. felt numb or detached from ppl, activities surrudnings
5. felt guilty/unable to stop blaming urself or others for the events/problems the events mightve caused 
trauma reminders = "triggers but dont use that"
- internal v external  
- recognizing the connections is critical for effective treatment 

amygdala always scans for threats - signals possible threat and u need that cortex to kick in to tell u it's okay. but the connection isn't happening so they stay in stress reponse for way longer 

avoidance - gasoline that keeps it going. trauma impacts how they see themsleve,s view the world, and how survivors repsond to the services 

impact - ptsd 80% of ppl who have it suffer from other psych disorders

trauma informed care - crucial 
- realize the widespread ipmact
- recognize - signs and symptoms of it in ppl of all systme of care
- respond = fully integrating knowledge abt it into polices, procedures and practices
- resist retraumatization of children, as well s adults who care for them 

6 key principles
- safety - lighting, exam room setup 
- trustworthiness and transparency - informing ppl about barriers to care, realism 
- peer support 
- collaboration + mutality = giving as much choice and autonomy as possible 
- empowerment, voice and choice= reconizing strengths, don't fragilize them! post traumatic growth is possible 
- cultural, historical and gender issues 

what is trauma inormed care
- screening
- following up post screen and have a warm handoff
- make activities predictable
- simple lang, allow for choice, direct instructions/modeling
- observe personal choice
- min number of providers
- stress mnagement 
- identify resources 
- careful with language 

evidence based trauma focused treatmet
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cognitive processing therapy - 12 sessions, 60 min = processing meaning of traumatic event, id and hcallenge unhelpful thoughts, worksheets + assignments</mark>
- prolonged exposure -12 session, 90 min, with their eyes clothes, recount the memory aloud to therapists repeatedly to help with avoidance; engages with epxosure activiies ouside of sessions 
- written exposure therapy - write abt the memory of this during session for 30 minute = more efficient, 5 sessions
