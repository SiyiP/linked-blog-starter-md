mood stabilizers = 4 drugs
some antipsychotics fall into this 

mood stabilizer = agent used in treatment of bipoolar / affective dz t o suppress swings bt mania + depresssion 

some are better at treating mania v depression and vice versa 
**nearly all 2nd gen/atypical antipsychotics are also approved for bipolar like combination or adjunctive therapy or sometimes monothrapy** 
and benzodiazepines are used but not indicated; slowing them down acutely 
1st gen antipsychotics are used when the 2nd gen antipsychotics and other mood stabilizers can't be used 



1. lithium 
	1. gold std for bipolar, in both manic + depression 
	2. 1-2 wks of use elims or reduces symptoms 
	3. work with psych person with this, needs monitoring bc small therapeutic window 
	4. SE: tremor, polydipsia , renal tox, thyroid changes and other tissues; think **LMNOP - lithium movement, neprhogenic DI, hypOthyroidism, pregnancy problems**
		1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">renal toxciity</mark> is huge. 10-20% of pts on it for 10+ yrs get morhpological kidney changes
		2. NDI = nephrogenic diabetes insipidus = kidneys don't respond to ADH,<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> can't concentrate ur urine with water reabsorption, so peeing out a lot of your water!!! always thirsty</mark>
		3. RTA = type 1 distal urine pH up 
		4. nephrotic syndrome mostly MCD 
		5. chronic interstitial nephritis 
		6. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inhibits vasopressin action by nhibiting the vasopressin receptor linked adenylyl cyclase + inositol phsophate signalling, so water resorption is slower...</mark>
			1. thiazide diuretics watch ur dose. 
		7. sodium depletion with sweating, diarrhea, vomitting, and stuff can cause -> **lithium toxicity** since it's being absorbed instead of sodium 
			1. and OD: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">coarse tremor, diarrhea, vomitting, coma, seizures, fatal </mark>
			2. need hemodialysis 
		8. also a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">teratogen = ebstein's heart anomaly with ASD and atrialized right ventricle , malformed tricuspid valve </mark>
	5. moa = suggested to have relation to efects as phosphatidylinositol PI recycling pathway 
		1. cells use PIP 2 in membranes for phospholipase C ,, using cleaving into IPC into IP3 and isoglycerol 
		2. ip3 binds into the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum to mobilize intracellular calcium 
		3. basically that IP3 needs to get shunted back, needs to get dephosphorylated into base inostol, which neurons need to generate their own 
		4. inhibits the phosphatase that would remove the IP3's phosphatase to make base inositol, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">so we can't make the PIP3 again. this dec the calcum in the body by stopping that pathway.</mark>
		5. ![[lithium moa.png]]
		6. basically when firing rates of neurons are abnormally igh, lithium treated ones are depleted of PIP2 and neurotransmission dependent on this 2ndary msg system is dampene
			1. reduction of DAG and IP3 inositol triphosphate 
			2. blocking hydrolysis of inositol IP to free inositol 
		7. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">therefore lithium selectively modulates function of this hyperactive neurons that contribute to the manic state.</mark>
		8. 

2. valproic acid
	1. this is anticonvulsant <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">specifically for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy</mark>
	2. and migraine prophylaxis
	3. effective <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">antimanic med, not much for depression</mark>
	4. SE: GI upset, rash, hepatotox, **pancreatitis**, Neural tube defects 
	5. MOA = putting brakes on the brain 
		1. block voltage gated na+ channels to prevent sustained repetitive firing f neurons 
		2. inhibit v-gated ca++ channels
		3. inc levels of GABA in the brain in vitro, seen to stimulate the activity of the GABA synthetic enzyme + inibit the GABA degradative enzymes
	6. continue to check LFT/CBC all the time, don't use in liver dz 
	7. good choice if pts also have migrains/seizures
	8. polycystic ovary dz 
3. carbamazepine 
	1. antimanic , also treat seizures + trigeminal neuralgia
	2. tricyclic structure
	3. [[MMT Anti-Seizure Medications_Blumer]] for MOA 
	4. TCA structure so a Anticholinergic properties
	5. huge inducr for CYP3A, increasing metabolism of itself over time too recall. 
	6. commonly couple it with warfarin or some kinda bleeding with the drug-drug interaction 
	7. SIADHs common in SSRIs too
	8. aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, risk of SJS with hla B1502 
	9. teratogen avoid in pregnancy 

4. lamotrigine 
	1. anticonvulsants
	2. good for depression/maintenance, not manic 
	3. inhibits v-gated na+ channels
	4. but we need to be careful bc of SJS by titrating over 6-8 wks

stimulants - treating ADHD + narcolepsy 
adhd - inattention or hyperactiivty onset be4 age 7 seen in 2+ settings
narcolepsy - REM sleep atacks, cataplexy , hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations 

med options
- psychostimulants = first line are dextroamphetamine , methylphenidate 
- atomoxetine (also first line)
- bupropion - 2nd line NDRI
effective adjuncts 
- a2 adrenergic receptor agonists clonidine + guanfacine 
- modafinil = more common for narcolepsy 

key receptors involved in adhd = alpha 2A=adrenergic receptors, which are huge for affecting working memory 
- animal studies show role of NE in activating the a2A-ARs to inc the strength of relevant sensory input to the prefrontal cortext
	- this is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">enhancing the signal </mark>
	- this is based on post-synaptic a2A-ARs 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">NE activates by inc TNF-alpha release, and then more and more pathways with suppressing cell death, making signals to the prefrotal cortex for working memory creation </mark>
- D1 dopamine activation of the receptors would <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">REDUCE NOISE</mark>
- stimulants wich will promote NE/DA activity in the pfc tend to help pts attend to the appropriate stimuli 
	- we add NE to increase signal 
	- add DA to reduce noise
	- these drugs would inc dopamine + ne release ... inhibiting reuptake or otherwise 
	- just bc these drugs make ppl respond doesn't mean they got ADHD 
- giving it in a pulsatile pulse, it will be more rewarding but if given in longer sustained time they are able to olock in better... so we use long-extension of releasing 

amphetamines = will inhibit DA and NE **reuptake, blocking VMAT from depleting it basically making the transporters work backwards**
- abuse oof this during pregnancy = growth reestrictiono 
- dopamine in the presynaptic neurons build up , and then they would force that dopamine transporter to work backwards, sending it out 
1. dextroamephetamine = adderall, and lisdexamhetaine work this way 
2. methylphenidate
	1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">allosterically blocking DAT/NET by bidnig to a separate site to prevent reuptake, does NOT impact VMAT</mark>
	2. basically working on DAT/NET, wthis will have a higher affinity to them than the bupropion 
	3. a more strong blocker of reuptake 
-  these stimulants can cause 
	- unmasked motor tics 
	- problems with appetite/growth suppression/insomnia 
	- prone to abuse/addictive
	- exacerbate anxiety/seizures
	- start low go slow!!! they're long acting + slow release 
	- SE:
		- sudden cardiac death = look into fam hx and EKG
		- psycosis/manic symptoms
		- peripheral vasculopathy like raynauds
		- growth suppression 
1. atomoxetine
	1. potent NE reuptake inhibitor = NRI
		1. will selectively inhibit presynaptic NE transporter 
	2. not stimulant but still inc NE which enhances working memory 
2. other ones - bupropion used off label for it 
3. and a2 ARs agonists clonidine 
	1. can be used for reducing noradrenergic transmission, helpful for hyperactivity = mimics the NE at a2 receptors which are primarily inhibitory... acts as a brake for further release causing sedation. 
	2. manipulation of NE also affects workng memory , this enhances working memory too 
	3. don't abruptly stop this bc of rebound htn
4. **modafinil** - mostly <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">narcolepsy</mark> first line...
	1. no moa 
	2. inc hypothalamic release o monamines + primarily inc histamines 
	3. glutamate circuits activated while inhibiting GABA

AD
- loss of cholinergic neurons in particular since ACH plays important role in memory formation, and then serotonergic + glutamatrgic neurons impact this too 
- ACH 
	- greatest influence n memory
	-  blocking muscarinic receptors like with atropine, will make memory deficiencies at low doses and delirium at higher ones 
	- cholinergic nuclei - like **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">nucleus basalis of meynert</mark>** 
		- if inc ACH lvls , project heavily to the neocortex/hippocampus, helps decreasing the threshold of neuronal activity necessary for learning 
	- maybe delay the progression of the disease 

manage their ADs
- an ach esterase inhibitoor is started for mild + moderate AD... small improvement seen 
- memantine or a NMDA antag is added to it for mod-severe AD 
- aducanumab - some controversy 
- lecanemab = another antibody against amyloid beta, reduced memory decline but this causes brain swelling 
	- humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody binding to high affininty A beta 
	- reduce decline by 27% 

1. donepezil - ache inhibitor, 70 hr half life
	1. **mild to moderate dementia**
	2. SE: n/v headache, appetite, suppression, diarrha, insomina, msucle cramps -= sludge
	3. causes bradycardia/heart block + syncope too 

some types of neuronal cell injury/death due to glutamate -induced excitotoxicity 
	where excessive glut in synapses -> runway depol of neurons
	excessive ca influx = cell death !!!!
	**so drugs that block this action is bing used for dementia therapies** 

1. memantine = nmda antag
	1. not a powerful one lke ketamine... 
	2. so no dissociative impacts
	3. preferentially inhibit excessive NMDA receptor activation which would be associated with excitotoxicity anyways without blocking in normal conditions
	4. used as add-on therapy with ACHE inhibitors 
	5. SE: dizziness, heaache, cnstapation,HF, seizures
2. lecanemab - binds to amyloid beta protofibrils preventing formation of A beta plaques/depo
	1. controversial 
	2. SE: infusion rxn like flushing, chills, fever, rash, and can cause amyloid related imging abnormallities liek brain swelling or small bleeds which lead to headache, confusion, dizziness, vision changes + seizures
