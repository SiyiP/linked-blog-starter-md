dementia + neurodegeneration. 
many causes of cognitive impairment - a lot 
- like vascular - stroke, global hypoxic-ischemic
- trauma
- congenital 
- autoimmune like ms and so on 

commonalities of all neurodegen 
- neuron death - loss of cell bodies + axons
- rarefaction = white spaces on brain loss of brain substance = more empty 
- gliosis glial rxn to injury like astrocytes
- macrophages - foamy histiocytes. 

vascular dementia 
- for ppl with multiple sequele of vascular dm g
- 2/2 multiple subcortical infarcs / ischemic lesions 
	- we see hyaline arteriosclerosis in the vessels - onion-skinning, replacement with thevessel walls
	- lacunar infarcs look like white space around bv rarefaction, vague triangular areas, and then the pinkish eosinophilic color surrounding is gliosis in the brain bgd.![[Screenshot 2025-11-27 at 10.14.53 PM.png]] 
- stepwise deterioraton - acute decline to another acute decline
	- stroke 1 -> decline to stroke 2 and then another decline in cognition 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">enalrged venticles due to loss of brain substance + lacunar infarcs of white matter and/or deep gray matter.</mark>
	- basically gross findings will depend on location + nature of the lesion . 
	- lacunar infarc - a slit little lesion 
	- hydrocephalus ex vacuo - enlarged ventricls in rsponse to inc pressure
	- in the deep gray matter we see more lacunar infarcs which are small holes that are long looking in the brain matter - involving basal ganglia. 
	- note the asymmetry bt L + R basal ganglia 
- basically a chronic progressive dementia caused by the dmg of the infarcs
- stepwise deterioration impacting memory, mood, cognition 
- psychiatric symptoms + focal motor signs
- causes - nuerous and anything vascular too; like lacunar infarcs 
-  can have overlap with other neurodegen dz 


alzheimers dz - AD
- most common form of dementia 
- usually begins after 50 
- incidence inc with each decade of life
- majority = sporadic. minoritys familial !!!
- slowly but consistently progressive, over 5-10+ years
- memory issues -> intellectual motor impairment -> severe loss of cognitive, speech, motor skills 
- gross. path - generalized atrophy - gyri have larger gap of sulci in between. 
	- most notable - frontal and temporal lobes are set apart 
	- relative sparing of occipital and sensory motor cortex. 
- on mri - we see atrophy with large ventricles and the sylvian fissure we see how expanded they are
	1. amyloid beta depositions - made secondary to cleavage of amyloid precursor protein app by **beta-secretase**
		1. abnormal structures - amyloid plaque and amyloid angiopathy (in bvs)
		2. transmembrane protein and then we dono't know what it normally does.... 
		3. many enzymes that would cleave, with alpha and gamma secrtase which would allow regular recycling and allows body to get rid of it... but if the beta one cleaves it will cause plaques. 
		4. these plaques have many diff stages of development but they are basically amyloid beta + abnormal neuron processes/dystrophic neurites => neuritic plaque! 
		5. note - cells get trapped in this plaque, dark on silver stain... abundance and distribution isn't highly correlated with symptom severity. 
	2. tau, hyperphosphorylated - neurofibrillary tangles 
		1. tau - microtubule associated protein with transport along axons 
		2. when they're abnormally phosphorylated they fall into tangles 
		3. EM = paired helical filaments - kinda archaic... low yield? 
		4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">abundance and distribution highly correlated with severity....</mark>
- alz genetic associations: 
	1. trisomy 21 = bc app on the chromosome 21, downs ppl have extra copy of this so early AD changes):
	2. apo e = apolipoprotein involved in gen and depo of amyloid, high risk with amyloid accumualation 
	3. presenillins - mutations leading to loss of function in alpha secretase, associated with early onset AD 


frontal or temporal lobar degeneration - FTLD
- peaks 45-65, 
- 80% sporadic
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">frontal lobe invlvement = personality and behavior changes</mark>
- temporal lobe predom = aphasea + memory loss
- terminally like all these other illnesses - pts have severely demented, mute state like AD
- may be seen in combo with parkinsonism or motor neuron dz (TDP-43 mutation which is ALS) so many of these combo cases are familial
	- FTLD-TDP (like with ALS TDP-43 mutation)
		- where the nucleus is blue and brown inclusion inside
		- there's like a cat's eye in the neuron. 
	- FTLD-tau = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pick disease</mark>
		- has neurofibrillary tangle and neurites
		- pick bodies = round, cytoplasmic neuronal tau inclusions 
	- FTLD-FUS
	- FTLD-UPS
- bross pathology = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">knife edge atrophy specifically in frontotemporal lobe!!!!</mark>

dementia w/ lewy bodies - very familiar bc they are parkinsons' !!!
- alpha-synucleinopathy like 
- dementia - 2nd most commn cause + movement disorder
- overlap with AD
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">these are corticoprominent whereas in parkinsons the lewy bodies are brain stem predominent</mark>
- key: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">visual hallucinations, REM sleep disorder they act out the dreams, and day to day fluctuations in function</mark>
- +/- parkinsonium 
- minimal atrophy grossly speaking 
- ![[lewy bodies.png]]
- very hot pink, eosinophilic made up of alpha-synuclein... altho it's harder to see in cortical neurons. 


chronic traumatic encephalpathy -CTE
- repetitive head trauma altho not everyone who has this will get this. 
- progressive -
- behavioral - impulsiveness, apathy, violence
- mood - depression, anxiety, suicide, SUD
- clinical/path overlap with other neurodegen dz 
- can only definitively dx post-mortem /: 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">we see phospho-tau reactive neurons, distribution of tau are in depths of sulci... cerebral cortex.!!!!!</mark>
- basically - we see the stains showing it into the sulci... into the base of the valley. 
- also perivascular accumulation too 

prions - group of fatal neurodegen dz abnormal accumulation of badly folded prions... <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">microscopic change of spongiform encephalopathy</mark>
	we get a diffuse widespread vacuolization of the brain ... and kuru type plauques everywhere. just spongey .... 
	there's immunostains of plaques that can tell u what type it's made up of. 
	<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">florid plaques = </mark> combo of amyloid plaque causd by prion with associated vacuolization of the plaque
- mostly sporadic - transmissible, inherited forms 
- mad cow dz - europe blood transmission and transfusion 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">creutzfeld-jakoob disease</mark> - CJD most common !
	- poradic
	- 10% inherited
	- iatrogenic transmission 
	- 50-70 yrs old will happen later in life
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">rapidly progressive!!!! dementia!!!! over like 6 months!!!</mark>
	- and startle myoclonus
	  EEG = periodic sharp wave copmlexes, imaging too with diffusion restriction of cortex ? and deep gray nuclei 
	- CSF = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">BEST = RT-QUIC taking their CSF and checking aggregation.</mark>
- PrPc = normal prion protein that can spontaneously convert to PrPSC from a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">alpha helix to beta pleated sheet</mark>
- as soon as this accumulates the aggregation of this occurs. 
- u need to throw surgical tools that are exposed to this away 
- this is a type of amyloid = prion protein plaques
