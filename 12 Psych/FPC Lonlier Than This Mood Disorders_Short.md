DSM5 and lang about it all 
20.8% of ppl get depression lifetime prevalence 
highly treatable for half the ppl , most common comorbid psych sdisorders + most common cause of disabiity p muc 

1. Major depression disorder
	1. need depressed mood/anhedonia ; 2+ wks, 
	2. Sig E Caps, at least 4+: sleep difficulties, Interest loss , guilty feels, energy lacking, concentration issues, appetite loss, psychomotor agitation, suicidal thoughts/death wish 
	3. mild/mod/severe, recurrent/remission/chronic 2+ yrs etc. all these specifiers too
	4. issue = 50% who have an episode will have another one 
	5. 2nd episode inc chance
	6. many have chronic relasping course; depression pit in 6 mon - 24 months and then remission 
	7. greatest mood relapse ithin 3 mon of recovery 
	8. each relapse = inc risk of treatment resistant depression 
	9. psychotic feeatures = some hallucinations or delusions. or mood congruency in these symptoms, feels like somatic situations like can't eat, rotting 
	10. odd presentations
		1. atypical depression, cognitive impairments, opposition, sexual promiscuity etc. 
	- etiology 
		- psychodynamics - repressed anger or ambivalently viewed lss ofbjs, 
		- cognitive - learned helplessness model 
		- biogenic amine hypothesis- NE, 5HT, DA 
		- circuit based pathology - hyperconnectivity, regional activity hypo/hyperactivity 
			- genetics, metabolic disorders? 
			- pathology bassed on brain chem? 
			- more like - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">quit thinking abt it just being a chem imbalance, like the corticolimbic dysfunctionw ith hypothetically the prefrontal cortex isn't regulating it well</mark>
			- or overconnected brains state , can be dysregulated and shocked
	- TREAT: pharmacotherapy (SSRIs/SNRIs), electroconvulsive therapy, augmentation of first line meds like with lithium, thyroid hromone, antipsychotics, psychotherapy good in mild to moderate cases, transcranial magnetic stimulation or light therapy if seasonal 
	- more emerging is vagal nerve stim, TMS, deep brain stem etc. 
	- ECT = Electrodes go into head, and EKG in heart, BP in the arm, and organ specific dosing, very sophisticated, monitoring the dose based on seizure duration + morphology. 
	- TMS = electrical energy on insulated coils on scalp -> magnetic fields passing thru the cranium. focal e-current in the brain , inc and dec the craving for ppl 
	- VNS - vagal nerve stimulation - they tried everything, this is usually for treating epilepsy 
	- DBS - a lot to be learned usually PD stuff
2. dysthymia
	1. a less severe depression for more days than not for 2+ years and. 1 year in children/adolescents
	2. 2+ other depressive symptoms 
	3. not euthymic/stable mental state is neutral 2+ mon at a time 
	4. usually treat with meds, but might be less responsive to psychotherapy? 
3. bipolar disorder type 1 + 2 
	1. typee 1 = more <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">severe</mark>, more mania, abnormally elevated, expansive, irritable lasting for 1 wk+ may need hospital or psychosis thing 
	2. type 2 = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hypomania</mark> - ditto, like 4 days only and no need for hospitalization or psychosis - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">must have depressive episode</mark>
	3. mixed episode - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">meet criteria for both depressive and manic episode for 1+ weeks</mark>
	4. cannot be caused by the substance or other thing 
	5. DIGFAST - need 3+ - distractability, indiscretion, gradiosity, flight of ideas, activity, sleep deficits , talkativeness 
		1. they get creative and then go off cycle and get into the insight of this one thing 
		2. 1.2 men, 1.8 women , family hx is very important, and need to see that this is SES higher more common 
		3. only 50+ % ppl experience mania will have recurrence. \
		4. and up to 40% experience mixed state
		5. 10-15% get rapid cycling BPAD defined as 4+ mood episodes a year 
	6. some models - 
		1. biological - evidence for changes in DA/5H5/NE,glutamate, gABA
		2. kindling phenomenon? - like a seizure
		3. psychodynamic theory - loss f regulatory ego , like superego + id take over, and coping doesn'thappen 
		4. circuits too? 
	7. TREAT:s mood stabilizers longstay, Antipsychotics acute/maintenance, benzo acute mania aids, ECT; careful with antidepressants
	8. about "bipolar" in KIDS:
		1. huge debate in psychology - a bit of language. so we came up with *disruptive mood dysrgulation do, which is for kids but don't start them on lithium j something else*
	9. also u can get this from a diff condition - mania and stuff from steroids and stuff - some other things - manic, hypomanic, mixed etc. mostly nonbrain things too like infection, metabolic, drug encephalitics, thyroid etc 
4. cyclothymia - 
	1. bipolar but not really major depression 
	2. chronic form of bipoalr just without the major depression part as strong 
	3. TREAT: lithium, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics
5. adjustment d/o
	1. different types - depressed mood, anxity, mixed or acute or chrnic
	2. can't change the situaiton 
6. substance induced
	1. very rare that substances can push ppl into it, like alchol use or stimulants that are overused. 
	2. usually resolves days to months. 
	3. mood disturbance developed during 1 mon intox OR withdrawal 
7. unspec
	1. due to anther med condition hypothyroidism is a classical case. 
	2. other specified DO = . recurrent brief short durations 
8. premenstrual dysphoric Do
	1. most cycles 5+ symptoms present in the final week before onset of menses, start to improve within after onset of menses and minimal / absent postmenses
	2. treat with SSRis, TMS, Oral contraceptives? 

when u mentally time travel like think about the future... or look into the past - this is due to a default mode network activity 
- ppl with depression has a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">high default mode network activity!</mark>
- can turn it down by exercise, meditate, TMS, a relationship with corticolimbic disorders 
- can be seen with ct scan - looking into circuit base disorders moree and also with some computational modeling 

SAINT TMS - 
- l dorsolateral prefrontal cortex targeted and found the max negative connectivity with subgenula cingulate - 
- computational modeling, every time this activity goes up , and the other goes down we treat it 
- this is doing 10 sesssions a day for 5 days popping them outta depression 
- we need to talk more about this now as an intervention 
- can scan ppl to predict their response to this too 
amygdala gamma power sufficient to detect high symptom severity state... 
- getting an EEG looking for real time tracking during depressive symptoms 
- DBS given to ppl close loop - following tis biomarker detection to see the circuitry which are abnoraml and treating it
