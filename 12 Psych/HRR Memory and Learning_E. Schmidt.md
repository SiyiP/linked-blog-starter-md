types
Explicit and implicit memory:  
• Implicit or nondeclarative memory: recalled unconsciously  
• Reflexive motor or perceptual skills – tie a shoe or ride a  
bicycle  
• Explicit or declarative memory: recalled consciously  
• Factual knowledge (e.g. of people, places, and things)  
• Further divided into  
• Episodic memory (events and personal experience)  
• Semantic memory (facts)

imedate memory - in every sensry modality - remember a scene 
working memory - hold + manipulate info while used for behavoral goal - keep hone number for dialing like 7-9 numbers

long term memory - store memb for days, week, lifetime even. 

memory helps us store + ntegrate stimuli over time even after it passes + it's no longer present 
- we can use this to make predictons and store + use to guide future actions! 

non-associative learning - habiuation/desensitization - dec in response to repeated benign stimulus
- reduced startle after first firework in 4th of jul 
sensitization. = enhanced prob of response to stimuli in terms of intense + noxious stimuli, like painful pinch = stronger response to a subsequent mild tactile stimulus 

memory - critical for learning 
nonassociative learning - very impactful - helps lead up to coplex behavioral responses, not relying on forming association bt first and subsequent timuli 
imitation learning - no obv associational eleemnt

associative learning - learn relation bt stimuli. + events
- classical conditioning - associate involuntary response to stimulus 
	- conditioned stimulus - CS = light/tone
	- unconditioned stimulus - US - food or shock 
	- pavlovian response - CS make animal salivate or react for the potential reward US 
	- new response = the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">conditioned response</mark>
	- but we get extinction - reduction of this response when CS repeatedly presented without the US 
	- forgetting/relearning association iis huge for adaptive behavior 
	this isn't just learning timing of 2 event sbut learning the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">probability of occurence bt the 2 events</mark>

operant conditioning - associate <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">voluntary behavior to consquence</mark>
- will do behavior like pushing button associate with specific outcome - receiving a reward
- predictive relaton between the stimulus + behavior 
- we need to have this behavior occur without the stimulus being there. 
- animal tends to repeat the behavior 

temporal categories of memory - 
- guy would learn easily , but struggle to read bc he couldn't remember how to read and had too much to remember. 
- he can't forget things so he doesn't have ability to retain and focus on the important information. 

amnesia - 
- anterograde. - can't make new membs
	- case - bilat med temporal lobe resection - removal of amygdala + hippocampal loss
	- normal short term memb, good long term pre-surgery, but inability to transfer short to long term 
- retrograde - can't recall memories be4 insult 
	- cycle accident - complete bilateral hippocampal loss 
	- specific loss of episodic memory with semantic memory intact
	- priming still intact like on implicit memory "tell me all the fruits which are this color."

animal models to study memory 
- rats with temporal lobe/hippocampal lesions
	- they can't do impaired morris water maze + other navigation tasks 

heavily distributed key regions 
- associative cortices - these regions will be first acquiring knowledge that would be stored as explicit memory!!!
- information distrib to hippocampal formation - parahippocampal + perirhinal cortex - > projection to the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">entorhinal cortex first,,, then from there -> hippocampal regionsl ike dentate gyrus, hippocampus(C1,2,3), subiculum</mark>
- then it goes back into entorhinal cortex + <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">then the associative cortical regions</mark>
	- note - the **entorhinal cortex really makes a transferative funnel. so dmg to this will really impact memory, super sensitive.** 
	- early pathological alz changes are here 

brain systems underlying declarative memory 
- complex vsual img - photo of an elephant - get associated with everything u knw about elephants. 
- information -> processed in association cortices -> hippocampus -> 
	- 4 stages of learning + memory!!!
		- info is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">encoded(going into the brain)</mark> as a represenation by **neuronal** ensembles 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">consolidated</mark>, making **labile memory -> stable memory trace  = huge with sleep promotion** 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">long-term storage in neocortical regions</mark>
		- eventually **retrieval or recalled to ractivate this stored memory = reconsolidation.** 
- how important is this to us? = this is a great influence in how well we encodde a particular event/fact 
- memory is fallible- evolved to serve specific behaviors + survival - not a photo copy but an interpretational one. 

brain systems - recall reactivates cortical regions which are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">also involved to encoding it, making it easier as a trace to be avaliable</mark>

**nondelcarative** memory - less cortical, more reliance on <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">basal ganglia and subcortical regions + connection with prefrontal cortex, seen with cerebellum, amygdala, primary sensory, other motor related aras like substantia nigra</mark>
- this is bc most of this **is in behavior** 
- atrophy like stroke, huntingtons, parkinsons, exhibit deficits in these types of learning! 
- behavioral memory, will act out motor skills we usually do subconsciously 


cellular mechs of learning 
- neurobio substrate of learning + memory? 
- firing of neurons - spiking activity - 
- currency of brain  - how neurons, following input integration would produce a resoponse is on the basis of brain computations 
- learning + memory - persistent chnages in firing patterns, 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">engram = physical embodiment of a memory</mark> - neuronal connections in the brain 

synaptic plasticity - many mechs to mod synaptic strength 
- many mechanisms to mod synaptic strength 
- we can modify it on presynaptic, post-synaptic and how neurons would actually respond to the input (intrinsic excitability)
- short term - transient change in strength that does NOT require protein synthesis 
- lon**g term - persistnet change in strenght oer days + longer = relies on protein synthesis + changes in gene expression**
- hippocampus -<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> long-term potentiation</mark> LTP = r**epeated high freq stimulation inc amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials** 
	- happens in more than humans 
	- more stimulation = more and more LTP in the hippocampus 
	- 
- and depression of synapses followign weak stimulation - long term depression - LTD = deterioration of memories
