epilepsy is common, with 9% oof population having seizure at some point, mostly clustering in very young or very old. 

70% of ppl can be seizure free with appropriate treatments

- seizure = paroxysmal single event caused by abnormal excessive/synchronous neuronal activity -> abnormal behavior/sensorium 
- epilepsy - condition with spontaneous unprovoked recurrent seizures 

types 
- focal/partial seizures - at seizure onset, only a limited area of brain in one hemisphere is affected
	- structural abnormality or injury 
	1. focal seizures without impaired awareness - consciousness not impaired, simple partial seizures 
		1. associated with motor symptoms, autonomic(hr sweating, flush), somatosensory, visual, **epigastric rising in the temporal lobe like when ur on a roller coaster**, 
		2. emotional/psychic symptoms, anxiety fear and doom or pleasure or memory 
		3. might be identified as their auras - 
	2. focal seizures with impaired awareness = complex partial seizures 
		1. automatisms - repetitive, pointless behaviors
			1. oral - chewing lip smacking swallowing spitting
			2. manual - grasping, fumbling, picking, tapping
			3. speech - repeating words, phrases 
	3. focal to bilateral tonic clonic seizures - secondarily generalized tonic clonic seizures = begins in a small portion of the brain but spreads to a larger area -> generalized seizure 
		1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">these are also known as grand mal seizures.</mark>
		2. key features - focal onset with head/eye deviation
		3. tonic phase - stiffening of limbs and ictal cry with the diaphragm compressing
		4. clonic phase - shaking back and forth in a rhythmic repetitive fashiono 
		5. then followed by postictal confusion - lasting min to hours, significant sedation/confusion 
- generalized seizure - majority of brain including both hemispheres are impacted, from the thalamocortical circuits 
	- these are likely genetic 
	- seizures that last more than a few seconds -> impaired consciousness
	1. absence seizures - begin in childhood + teens , abrupt interruption with blank stare
		- last up to a min, provoked by hyperventilation 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">these also known as petit mal seizure</mark>
		- they can resume normal activities as soon as seizure conclude often if nothing happened
		- can be mistaken for adhd 
		- this is in kids. mainly 
		- EEG - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">rhythmic, symmetric pattern of generalized 3 Hz spike and wave discharges seen all throughout the ENTIRE EEG simultaneously</mark>
	2. myoclonus - caused by brief seizure a fraction of a second of a jerking movement in limbs
		- dropping objs
		- consciousness not impaired
		- occasionally normal myoclonus while drowsy or asleep 
		- has this for years - not normal 
	3. febrile seizures - seen in 3% of neurologically norm infants/children
		- 6 mon - 5 years of age
		- no treat simple seizures
		- complex = treatment is debatable with no evidence that these would cause injury or cog problems or that it would prevent epilepsy 
		1. simple febrile seizures - less than 15 min, only one in 24 hours, generalized both arms both legs, no inc risk of epilepsy 
		2. complex febrile seizures - 15+ min, more than 1 in 24 hrs, and it's focal/partial - then yes RF for getting epilepsy 
	4. infantile spamss
		- before 12 mon typically 
		- brief flex/extension movements of axial + limb muscles
		- looks like head drop when sitting up 
		- lasts 1-2 s
		- may occur frequently 10-100 times a day 
		- 70-80% strutural, genetic, and metbolic abnormality 
			- usually they wont be meeting developmental milestones ): 
			- 20% die 
			- 80% huge moderate to severe cog impairment 
		- TREAT: ACTH or high dose steroids, or vigabatrin. irreversible gABA transaminase inhibitor = these are treatments for that spasm, not the underlying abnormality ): 
		1. west syndrome = infantile spasms, dev delay, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hypsarrhythmia, which is high amp, chaotic, disorganized EEG pattern with multifocal epileptiform abnormalitiies, very ugly EEG</mark>
			1. if u turn it upside down it still looks the same!!! very disorganized
	5. lennox gastaut syndromoe - severe childhood epilepsy syndrome
		- many seizur types are here
		- intellectual disability 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">atonic seizures = drop attacks with pts losing tone  ONLY seen in pts with cogniitive impairment which is here</mark>
		- tonic seizures - stifffening without subsequent shaking (clonic movements)
		- slow 1-2 hz spike and wave discharges
		- 24-30% are preceding west syndrome 
		- poorly responsive to therapy ): 

syncope - loss of consciousness from insufficient cerebral blood flow - 
- 50+% have a trigger, overheating, anxiety, dehydration, hypoglycemia, etc. 
- prodrome - lightheadness, palpations, nausea, diaphoresis, feeling warm/shakey 
- 70-90% will get convulsive movements usually <30  seconds, which will be interesting 
	- sending out epinephrine in CNS to keep brain perfused, so we get a bunch of sympathetic things 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">these are arrythmic unlike seizures which are rhythmic.</mark>
	- this is what confuses ppl with seizures
- 20+% have incntinence 
- this is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">flaccid fall!!!</mark>
- while seizures are stiff!!!!
- it's alsoo rare to bite the tongue in syncope 
- and postictal confusion is very brief. 

other things that mimic seizures
- migraine aura
- TIA
- narcolepsy with cataplexy 
- psychogenic nonepileptic events 

seizure first aid 
- ABCs - airway breathing= biggest issues!!! 
- turn to side if possible to stop saliva aspiration 
- move hard and sharp obj away 
- don't put objects into their mouth or restrain them 
- most seizures will resolve spontaneously in <2 min 
seizure eval 
- hx - many present to ER with first tonic clonic seizure but many happen to have past other seizures. 
	- provoked seizures? - caused by drugs/alc, infections, electrolyte abnormalities , glucose... but otherwise normal brain 
	- adult with one seizures and normal exam.... only 30-40% have another seizure. most ppl who have one seizure with normal brain will not get a 2nd one so we don't put them on seizure meds 
	- risk factors - head trauma, stroke, infection, family hx, febrile seizures, delay/autism, dementia , tumors 
- phys ex - 
- EEG - uses 16-22 lectrodes to record signals 
	- in 50-60% of patients EEG will be abnormal between seizures
	- id type of seizure focal vs generalized 
	- can help to localize focal seizures 
- MRI - igher sensitivity for epilepsy making structural abnormalities 
	1. mesial temporal sclerosis - causing temporal lobe epilepsy most common cause 
		1. atrophied, sclerotic hippocampus or amygdala 
		2. febrile seizures, brain trauma and dementia 
		3. majorly have no idea how their temporal lobe got injured. 

seizure meds - 
SE common - sedation, dizziness, n/headache, diplopia, ataxia 

med failure - 1/3 epilepsy pts not controleld with drugs
might treat with: 
- resective epilepsy surgery - 1/3 refractory focal epilepsy - resective surgery candidates
- which area of the brain is responsible for seizures? 
- for smaller epileptogenic zone, laser ablation also possible
- one must have: 
	- epileptic seizures only from one location 
	- well-localized
	- and area must not be resopnsible for important functions 
	- 60-70% of well selected pts are seizure free 5 years post op 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">best outcomes = unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis!</mark>

- vagus nerve stimulator - placed below calvicle connected to vagus nerve
	- over time decreases severity of the seizures with 50-60% significant reduction but only 5-9% seizure free 

- responsive neural stimulation - implanted electrode into cortex to inhibit some parts 
	- avg 60% reduction 
	- but 13% of pts had one year of seizure free
	- good op for ppl who can't have surgery bc seizures coming from other places
-

- deep brain stim - stimulates anterior nucleus of thalamus, 
	- 40% reduction after 1 yr and 60% after 5 

ketogenic diets - very restrictve - finding that starvation = improved control 
- low carbs 
- patients to ketosis + acidosis
- moa unknown??? 
- maybe ketones made? idk 
- hard to adhere to obviously
