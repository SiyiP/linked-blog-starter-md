monoamine theory of depression 
- oversimplistic? debates?
- functinal deficit of monoamine transmitters like NE and 5-H% at certain sites within the brain! 
but this is huge for explaining why it takes weeks of this therpy for this drugs to work! super longterm needs to do this 
- long-term adaptations in the brain fucntion due to the different levels are huge ... 

neurotrophic hypothesis - adaptive changes in protein phosphorylation, gene expression + protein translation happen in target neurons that ultimately relieves symptoms 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inc in Ca++ and some caMP after longterm treatment with antidepressants can lead to BDNF more increased brain derived neurotrophic factor, causing inc survival of vulnerable neurons</mark>

a lot of these SSRI drugs and related are also first line therapies for treating anxiety disorders; often comorbid with depression. 

TCAs and SSRIs can be used for neuropathic pains, 
TCAs for IBS/enuresis etc. 

in contrast of psych disorders like bipolar, we can have complete remission in treating depression - 
- no one size fits all - mainly trial and error. 
- pharmacogenetics are huge in major role in seeing who responds to what 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">also placebo effect = one of the disorders that are the most responsive to this is depression </mark>

monoamine oxidase inhibitors MAOIs
- regulates the metabolic degradation of catecholamines, serotonin + other amines in the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CNS AND peripheral tissues!!!</mark>
- MAO-A = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">NE and 5-HT metabolism, and MAO-B s for DA metabolism</mark>
- so basically bind <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">irreversibly</mark> to BOTH! soo basically more NE/5-HT accumulates in presynaptic stores and more to be released nad stay intraneuronally
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">requires 4-6 wks til effects seen</mark>
- AES: food drug interacton - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">htn crisis, serotonin syndrome when combined with other antidepressants like TCAs/SSRIs and SNRIs, orthostatic hypotension, weight gain, ED;;; htn CRISIS!!! with tyramine (beer, aged cheese)</mark>
	- serotonin syndrome
		- hypothermia, shivering, rigidity, and muscle issues
		- variable mental status, tachycardia, sweating while shivering, fever, labile bp, drooling, agitated, hypotensive, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">clonus, hyperreflexia</mark>
		- associate serotonergic meds with these!!! 
		- distinguish from neuroleptic malignant syndrome which is in antipsychotics lecture instead. 
		- treat - with cyproheptadine 5-HT antagonist 
1. phenelzine
2. tranylcypromine
3. selegiline - more MAO-B selective but will inhibiti. both when the dose is normal 
Tricyclic antidpressants - TCAs
- act as **competitive inhibitors of high afffinity uptake synstem for NE and 5-HT**; NET and SERT will be inhibited!!! 
- blocks reuptake of NE/5-HT into their terminals 
- potency varies, takes some time for this to work ; not first line but can be <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">effective in neuropathic pain. sleep disorder, migraine, anxiety. off label for ibs</mark>
- **dirty medictations!!**
	- 1. blocks histamine H1 receptors too - weight gain + sedation 
	2. alpha1 adrenergic receptor block = orthostatic hypotension 
	3. muscarinic receptor block - dry eyes dry mouth, urinary retention 
	4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this is lethal in overdose, due to heart effects - blocking of sodium channel in the heart</mark>
		1. lifethreatening arrythmia = super widened, abnormal QRS!! and prolonged QT , sudden cardiac deaths!!!!
		2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">also see mydriasiss, hyperthermia, flushign, tachycardia, big hot dry fast, CNS altered mental status + tachycardic too</mark>
		3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">coma, convulsions, and cardiac. </mark>
		4. therapy -<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> sodium bicarb to reverse the sodium channel blockade!!!</mark> saline for hypotension and benzos to control agitation 
1. amitriptyline - tertiary - more serotinergic 
	1. better for neuropathic pain 
	2. very sedating 
	3. used for associated insomnia, fibromyalgia 
	4. blocks histamine H1 receptors too - weight gain 
	5. alpha1 adrenergic receptor block = orthostatic hypotension 
	6. muscarinic receptor block - dry eyes dry mouth, urinary retention 
2. imipramine - tertiary - more serotinergic 
	1. better for neuropathic pain 
	2. sedating, reducing stage 4 sleep 
	3. sudden cardiac effects
3. desipramine - secondary amines, less anticholinergic better for elderly 
	1. greater norepinephrine effects ; off label for ADHD

selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs- more first line for both depression + anxiety
- selectively block reuptake of serotonin without impacting NE reuptake 
- more safe 
- AEs: sexual dysfunction, weight gain, sleep disturbances (some sedating some activating), anxiety worsens initially, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">SIADH </mark>from loss of salt 
- inc risk of suicidal ideation in kids/young adults!!! 
- effect takes several weeks 
5. fluoxetine - long half life of days bc active metabolite
	1. cyp2d6 inhibitor! knw there's some interactions 
	2. useful in pregnancy as cat C
	3. useful for EDs - like **bulimia**!!! 
	4. anxiety disorders start low go slow 
6. paroxetine
	1. short half life **but** watch out for **withdrawal like brain zaps, flu and dizziness**
	2. less well tolerated
	3. cyp2d6 inhibitor 
	4. sedating
	5. inc risk fo sexual dysfunction 
	6. c<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">at d - preg risk avoid!!!</mark>
7. sertraline
	1. common or anxiety + depression 
	2. **less drug drug interactions** 
	3. **some safer in pregnancy** 
	4. AE: GI side effects. 
8. citalopram
	1. low risk of drug drug interactions
	2. minimal weight changes !!! 
	3. sedating
9. escitalopram
	1. s-enantiomer of citalopram - better tolerated 
	2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">polypharmacy concerns - lowest drug drug interctions, DOC when interactions are a huge concern!!!</mark>

serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors SNRI
- block both serotonin and epi reuptake ;helpful in depression/anxiety and also some neuropathic pain disorders
11. venlafaxine
	1.  similar to TCAs but without a lot of side effects like overdose. 
	- dose dependent inhibition 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">low dose inhibit 5-HT reuptake, medium at NE reuptake inhibition, and highest doses DA reuptake inhibition</mark>
	- AES: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">less well tolerated, inc risk of hypertension!!!!</mark> n/gi upset, sexual dysfunction, +  serotonin syndrome 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">short half life, so flu symptoms on withdrawal!!!! </mark>
12. duloxetine - SNRI at low doses
	1. AEs: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">avoid in renal disease!!!! and other things that fall into the same pattern of ssris but worse</mark>
	2. also beware of flu on withdrawal 
	3. for mdd, fibromyalgia + diabetic neuropathy 
	4. tramadol is an snri which is converted into opiioid .... look out for serotonin syndrome 
NE-DA reuptake inhibitors NDRIs
13. bupropion - similar too amphetamine 
	1. elevates dopamine and NE by blocking reuptake moa somewhat unclear. 
	2. rather <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">activating, benefits MDD + fatigue/hypersomnia</mark>
	3. commonly added to SSRI therapy to get them into remission 
	4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">no sexual dysfunction and can maybe make it better</mark>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	5. anxiety wrsened + inc 
	6. can cause weight losss + dry mouth/n/v ; <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">avoid in patients with eating disorders + dose-dependent risk of seizures due too electrolyte abnormalities</mark>
	7. horrible <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">arrhythmias too!! in od with sympathomimetic properties</mark>
	8. also for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">smokign cessation+ adhd</mark>

Serotonin antag and reuptake inhbitor SARIs
15. trazodone 
	1. blocks 5-HT2a receptor ; dirty moa but basically would <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">increase 5-HT, NE and DA release!</mark>
	2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">highly sedating, also potent alpha1 blocking activity with orthostatic hypotension + sedation!!!!</mark>
	3. risk of priapism = painful erection of penis 
a2-adrenergic receptor antagonists 
16. mirtazapine - 
	1. blocking presynaptic alpha 2 receptors to inc levels of NE and 5-HT
		1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">alpha2 receptors - if u block this, u facilitate that NE release!!! these are nt only on the NE but also on Serotonergic neurons!!!!</mark>
		2. also blocking 5-HT3 receptors - which is important bc <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this is contributing to lack of nausea.</mark>
	2. veryyy <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sedating - signiifcant H1 blocker + no significant sexual dysfunction!!!!!</mark>

approaches to tretng 
- if pt doesn't respond after approaching dosing limits, switch to another antidepressant
- if partial response think either
	- augmentation esp with bupropion, mirtazapine, tcas etc.
		- or with aytpical antipsychotics 
	- or dose escalation 

nonpharm approaches
- cbt - should always be offered as an add on or an appraoch 
- Ect - more resistnat forms of depression, some rounds are there 
- dbs 
- tms 
-
