#psych #clinics 

MSE overview = should reflec dz process, a snapshot in time as dynamic not static + elicit evidence of metnal/psych dysfucntion + prep others for patient interactions 
components
- behavioral - cooeprative, stress? how pts act to the examiner
- psych = how they function emotionall, organizes their thoughts, assessing hallucinations
- neurological - how their nervous system is doing ? aphasias, memory, orientatin, and otherwise tremors 


elements!!!
how do they appear? and how they're interacting during interview 
	appearance
		think - dress, grooming, hygiene, posture, id the patient, note distingushing characteristics 
		"appears stated age, appropriate grooming + hygiene"
	behavior
		how they're behaving during interview + other ppl? 
		eye contact looks like ? 
		how react to the stress of an interview 
	motor/gait
		no psychomotor retardation or activation, no tremor, normal gait
		some level of activities? EPS assessment, abnormal movements
		gait, balance, tremor 
		remember to thnk abt pertnent negatives 
	speech/lang
		appropriate rate rhythm volume + tone?
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">prosody = element of rhythm/cadence, emotional character/tone</mark>
		- latency - prolonged perioid bt thought + verbal expression like with catatonia 
		- neurologic - slurring? dysarthria, aphasia, fluency etc. 
		
how are they functioning psychologically during interview 
	mood
		what do they say during the interview - put in quotes 
	affect
		what do u see/ability to emote?
		range of affect = think range of emotion broad/full range or narrow/constricted 
		reactivity = change in response to content of discussion 
		motility - pace of movement from one emotion to the next; sluggish in depression and labile = fast 
		is it congruent or incongruent with stated mood? 
		- euthymic - this is like "normal" in the middle
		- flat , blunted, constricted and restricted all reduced ability to emote... 
			- flat is the most to the left followed by blunted then constricted then the restricted 
		- and manic is all the way on the other end 
			- superficially bright -> elevated -> expansive and labile. -> manic at the very end of increased affective response. 
	thought content
		what can't u help BUT think about? 
	perceptions
		how is ur brain perceiving the world? 5 senses
		hallucination = experience brain creats
		illusion = misperception of real physical experience
		active dissociation during interview can be commented here 
	thought process 
		linear logical and goal directed is normal 
		how are you thinking? 
		3 elements
		- linearity = does one thoguht lead to the next?
			- flight of ideas bipolar dz = quickly framing thought - challenging to follow 
				- mostly logical in terms of connectedness to the previous sentence but the topic repeatedly and quickly changes. 
				- there IS a thread but shifts too fast in topic 
			- loosening of association - stuck on a paragraph... can't follow how someone cme to the 2nd 2 thougths from the 1st 2 . 
				- no topical connction bt statemetns or connection isn't a logical one 
		- organization = are thoughts arranged logically in a way that's ez understood?
			- must rudimentary - 
			- word salad, clang association (not making sense but statements based on rhyme/alliteration of wors)
			- signitificantly disordered thoughts at this level. 
		- goal direction = do statements have a purpose and are meaningful 
			- first thing to go in the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">most complex function... circumstantial -> tangential</mark>
			- circumstantial = going the long way, giving a lot of infrmation, a bit long-winded. 
			- tangential will be following the threat but will show some other things that aren't related to the purpose
	insight
		ability to recognize pathology + how it impacts life 
	judgement
		ability to *make* decisions based on appropriate insight 
		apply this to specifically their pathology/why they are there. 
what's their neurocognitive functioning like during interview 
	orientation 
		4 W - who, where, when, why 
		oriented to person , place, time, and situation 
	intelligence
		generally an estimation based on conversation but shouldn't change with time 
	concentration 
		great to ask bc delirium is huge 
		wide range 
		attending to the interview?
		distractable
		serial 7s 
		months of the year backwards
		luria three step 
		world backwards 
	memory 
		immediate - new learning names of pts, registration + delayed recall in 5 min 
		recent. - short term, events of day? circumstances of hospitalization 
		remote = long term historical life events
		non-verbal - directions/following a task 

MMSE - folstein mini mental state exam 
- one type of this 
- scored out of 30 
- 25 or greater is "normal"
- just a small context of age, edu lvl, overall functioning 
- one score doesn't mean anything - no speciic qs associatd with dementia 
- used best for following a patient inpatient without dx 

moca - montreal cog assessment
- out of 30 
- 26+ is normal 
- accounts for highest edu level
- more sensitive for ppl with higher intellectual level
- sensitvie for mild cog impairment
- assessing exec functioning!!!
