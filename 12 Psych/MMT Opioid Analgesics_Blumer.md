focus on moa + physiological effcts of agonists on the body - anticipate the SEs 

opioid = all accompancing term incluside of opitate (naturally occuring alkaloids like morphine)
all opioids act by binding to opioid specific receptors which mmic action of endogenous peptide NTs

- endogenous opioid peptides from POMC , Proenkephalin a, and proenkephalin b 
- pomc - has sequences for many peptides inclusive of nonopioid ones like ACTH, melanocyte stimulating hormone etc
- preproenkephalin (A) and preprodynorphin (B) make <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">endogenous peptides enkephalin and dynorphin</mark>
- b-endorphin , enkephalin and dynorphin have overlapping and difff affinities for 3 <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">major opioid receptors mu, delta, kappa</mark>
- painful stimuli -> cause release of these peptides \

opioid receptors
- mu - most of opioids are due to this MOR activation !!!
	- responsible for euphoria, physical dependence, craving, addiction 
	- also resp depression + decreased GI motility 
- delta
	- dor
	- analgesia + mood elevation 
	- not used clinically 
- kappa 
	- KOR, analgesia, sedation, dysphoria 
	- not commonly therapeutically used bc prouce dysphoric + psychotomimetic effects

all 3 receptors are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">gpcrs, coupling to Galpha i signalling!!!</mark>
- downstream of receptor beinging, we release a G alpha and G beta subunit 
- G alpha would mean cAMP and AC and PKA activation down 
- while the beta subnit
	- presynpatically the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Ca++ channels are inhibited, inhibiting NT release</mark>... L=type calcium channel inhibited. = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">presynaptic autoreceptor mechanism basically</mark>
		-  this action depends on which neuron type it is expressed on 
		- can inhibit via glutaminergic neurons 
		- or disinhibit certain activities on gabanergic neurons 
	- postsynaptically opioid receptor activation stimulates GIRK channels, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">efflux K+ to hyperpolarize postsynaptic neurons decreasing their activity</mark>
		- quiets down neuronal activity in post synaptic one 
ascending pain pathway 
- activation goes thru the C5 -> dorsal horns and then the CNS 
- signal will release signal into the 2ndayry neuron that eventually goes up to the CNS 
- when using mu opioid agonist.... 
	- this inhibits / **blocks** the NT , which is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">substance P which will send a signal for pain</mark>
	- this blocks pain perception ! 
	- and the voltage of the postsynaptic neuron of the dorsal horn is now hyperpolarized, so reducing excitatory neurotransmission; activating potassium channels
descending pain pathway 
- periaqueductal gray PAG in the brainstem have opioiid receptors in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">GABAnergic neurons</mark>
- when u inhibit the ca++ on the periaqueductal gray gaba neurons, u disinhibit signaling 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the periaqueductal gray will send out more NE and serotonin, which is enhanced in the release into the dorsal horn, attenuating excitability</mark>
- this explains why drugs that inc NE and 5-HT are used in neuropathic pain disorders. 

mood alteration 
- opioids make a lot of rewarding properties which are not really understood
- these mu-opioid receptors are once again on GABAnergic neurons in the projections to the Nucleus accumbens. 
- so basically the GABAnergic tone in the NAc are disinhibited, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">and the amount of DA release in these will go up, driving that rewarding property</mark>

effects on sedation are greatly inc when combined with other cns depressants + sedatives 

sex hormones
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">chronic opioid therapy leads to endocrinopathies, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism</mark>
	- dec libido/reduced secondary sex 
	- and irregular menses 
- prolactin = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">release from anterior pituitary is under inhibitory control by DA from the neurons of arcuate nucleus</mark>
- MOR agonists act presynaptically on DA-releasing nerve termminals meaning <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">DA release is down in the arcuate nucleus, therefore prolactin is up</mark>

miosis !!!
- at high doses, miosis is pronounced, and pinpoint pupils are pathognomonic for o/d
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">edinger westphal nuc activates parasympathetic outflow, producing this. this is regulated by GABAnergic interneurons, which will be disinhibited by opiates... leading to too much</mark>; a lot of ACH released do make this happen 
- doesn't exhibit tolerance!!! aka if u chronically took opioids u need to take higher dose. this means u can't just keep taking opioids to make ur pupils not pinprick. 

n/v 
- direct <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">stiulation of chemoreceptor trifgger zones in medulla for emesis ... all clinically useful mor have this effect</mark>
- also <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">suppresses the cough reflex by cough center effect in medulla</mark>

GI motiilty - 
- receptors are highly distributed in enteric neurons... 
- many ppl get <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">constipated; noo tolerance to this</mark>; major issue in cancer pain. 
- gallbladder 
	- agonists contract biliary sm, resulting in colic. all cause <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">biliary spasm... they constrict sphincter of oddi, resulting in reflux of biliary + pancreaic secretions and elevatd amylase/lipase lvls</mark>
	- 

respiratory depression is key morbidity !!!!
- morphine like opioids depress thru MOR 
	- -RR and tidal vol rely on <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">intrinsic rhythem generators in the ventrolateral medulla, which are directly depressed by the opioid agonists</mark>
	- CO@ = our ventilltory response to PCO2 is depressed.... 
	- and then the hypoxia driven ventilation is also depressed due to mor activation on carotid/aortic body chemoreceptors that reduce ventilatory responses. 

bladder
- causes urinary retention bbc inhibit the urinary voiding reflex 

histamine release
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">morhpine induces histamine release from mast cells, causing vasodilation </mark>
- unpleasant itching, flushing , etc. 
- pruritis = accompanies morphine and other opioids but not other like fentanyl 

uses
- acute pain, cough suppression, diarrhea/decreasing the gi motility 

1. morphine 
	1. selective full agonist for MOR but some for dor/kor too 
	2. analgesia for acute pain + periop pain management 
	3. resp depression, sedation, n/constapation, etc. everything we talked about 
	4. CIs: dec pulm function, head injuries bc <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">icp goes up, and neonatal abstinence syndrome is in fetuses so avoid usse in pregnancy</mark>; ppl with liver/kidney dz 
		1. these are metabolized by liver and elim in kidneys 
2. hydromorphone 
	1. selective full agonist for MOR but some for dor too  ; <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">longer half life than morphine</mark>
	2.  analgesia for acute pain + periop pain management 
	3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pruritis and flushign/hypotension in that histamine release is less likely</mark>
3. fentanyl 
	1. full agonist at mor, 1<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">00x more potent </mark>than morphine<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> short acting</mark>
	2. periop pain management, patchs for severe acute pain like cancer pts
4. oxycodone
	1. oral administration, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">lower binding affinity to MOR than morphine</mark>
	2. can be immediate release or controlled extended release for moderate pain, coformulate with acetaminophen 
	3. in sustained release tablets, it leads to misuse and fatal od by crushing and injecting 
5. tramadol 
	1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">prodrug with parent compound blocking re-uptake of serotonin + NE... like an SNRI</mark>
	2. gets converted to a mu-opioid agonist by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cyp2D6</mark>
	3. it's an okay medicatin/agonist, it's marketed as a safer alternative but pts with the full loss of function 2D6 alleles or taking meds which inhibit it won't experience full analgesic effects, being at risk of serotonin syndrome 
		1. prone to many many polymorhisms
	4. moderate pain.... 
	5. SEs: avoid combining with other sertonergic drugs <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">bc of serotonin syndrome.</mark>
	6. inc <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">seizure</mark> risks 
6. codeine
	1. prodrug converted to morphine via cyp2D6
	2. again same deal: 
		1. LOF alleles = lack of response
		2. GOF = rapid metabolizers susceptible to od/toxicity 
	3. for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cough suppressants and mild to mod pain</mark>
	4. SE: similar to morphine but less pronounced basically 
7. loperamide
	1. mor agonist that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">doesn't cross BBB... so only peripheral actions which slow GI motility to treat diarrhea</mark>
8. methadone
	1. full agonist at MOR + NMDA blocking 
	2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">long duration of action with good oral bioavaliability</mark>
	3. for Medication assisted therapy for OUD 
	4. we can help patients <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">wean themselves off of OUD due to prolonged duration</mark>
	5. chronic pain maangagement
	6. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">slow clearance of methadone to mild amt, prolonged qtc and torsades</mark>
9. buprenorphine - mor partial agonist
	1. 25-50x more potent than morhpine
	2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">slow dissociation from receptor, long duration of action </mark>
	3. they're more like antagonists...... but this one is goood binds to the receptor + activates a decent amount 
	4. less euphorigenic than full agonists and has <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">lower abuse potential</mark>
	5. pain treated and severe resp depresson is less possible
	6. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">not effective PO, extensive first pass metabolism so use IV/sublingual</mark>
	7. SE: high affiniity for MOR, so displacing full agonists, leading to withdrawal symptoms in a dependent patient. 


overdose
- coma, pinpoint pupils, resp depression, coma low RR, low body temp, flaccid skeletal msucles 

1. naloxone - 
	1. opioid antg on all 3 opioiid receptors
	2. very poor oral bioavailabity needs intranasal or otherwise
	3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">note - duration is very shorter than most opioids. multiple or continuous dose of naloxone may be needed with more time monitoring</mark>
	4. very well tolerated if any 
	5. but can precipitate withdrawal symptoms 
2. naltrexone
	1. opioid antag on all 3, just wiht <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">good oral bioavaliability + longer duration of action</mark>
	2. be clean for some time otherwise u get withdrwal symptoms 
	3. for aud, for combination with bupropion for weight loss
	4. SE: similar to naloxone, precipitates withdrwal, causes hepatotoxicity
