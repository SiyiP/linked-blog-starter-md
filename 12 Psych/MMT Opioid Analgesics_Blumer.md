opioid = all accompancing term incluside of opitate (naturally occuring alkaloids like morphine)
all opioids act by binding to opioid specific receptors which mmic action of endogenous peptide NTs

- endogenous opioid peptides from POMC , Proenkephalin a, and proenkephalin b 
- pomc - has sequences for many peptides inclusive of nonopioid ones like ACTH, melanocyte stimulating hormone etc
- preproenkephalin (A) and preprodynorphin (B) make <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">endogenous peptides enkephalin and dynorphin</mark>
- b-endorphin , enkephalin and dynorphin have overlapping and difff affinities for 3 <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">major opioid receptors mu, </mark>
