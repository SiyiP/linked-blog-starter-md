primary headaches- benign headaches and don't have separate underlying etiology requiring further work up 
- majority of pts presenting with headaches have a primary headache
1. tension type 46-78% 
	1. prevalence peaks 30-39 yo , more in women slightly 
	2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">bandlike, like a rubber band around head, bilateral, nonpulsatile pain mild to moderate</mark>, dull , vice-like quality, 
		1. additional nuchal nightness.... but phono/photophobia is uncommon. 
	3. infrequent episodic - <1 day/mon 
	4. freq episodic - 1-14 days/mon 
	5. chronic 15+ days per month for more than 3 months 
	6. triggers = variable, depression, anxiety, stress... 
	7. TRAEAT: variable treatments, acute NSAIDs and chronic amitripyline (TCAs) prophylatic but no med overuse headache 
2. migraines 14-16% 
	1. more in women 
	2. 20-50 yo 
	3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">unilateral pulsatile pain attacks mod-severe, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia</mark> , activity exacerbated, and may present with or without aura (sensory disturbance preceding, lasting 5-60 min)
		1. lasts hours 
		2. unilateral 
	4. TREAT: NSAIDs/triptans, antiemetics for nausea ... overuse of tripans = medication-overuse attacks ; also CGRP blocking drugs, DA receptor antagonist as antiemetics too 
	5. can get <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cortical spreading depression = CSD = wave of neuronal + glial depolarization - triggering release of inflammatory mediators + further activates trigeminovasc system</mark>
	6. neurogenic inflammation, vasodilation + pain transmission to cortical areas.. + <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">activation and sensitization of trigeminovascular system is a primary pathway.... trigeminal ganglion neurons with CGRP innervate meningeal bvs, and then when activated, release vasoactive peptides causing vasodilation + inflammation.</mark>
	7. lasting hours... 
	8. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">chronic = 15+ headache days/mon for 3+ mon , hx of 5+ migrain attacks, 8+ days/mon with migrain feats or response to treatment </mark>
3. trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias <1%  = if u have concern for this u gotta refer too 
	1. cluster headaches = uncommon, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">unilateral pain with ipsilateral cranial parasympathetic autonomic ffeatures like lacrimation, rhinorrhea, diaphoresis</mark>
	2. primary headache form of this... most common types. men > women 
	3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">series of severe unilat pain to orbital, supraoorbital, brief but frequent, and also restlessness/ipsi CN autonomic sx</mark>
		1. stabbing/burning 
		2. triggers - alc, insomnia, nitrates, light  

secondary - can be more life threatening 
- Meningitis  
• Encephalitis  
• Carcinoid syndrome  
• Lyme disease  
• Pheochromocytoma  
• Collagen vascular disease
and neoplasms 
or neurologic deficits - 
- sudden onset = subarachnoid hemorrhage 
- older age = giant cell arteritis , neoplasm 
Posttraumatic onset  
• Acute or chronic posttraumatic headache, subdural hematoma
Painkiller overuse or new medication  
• Medication overuse headache, drug adverse effec


vitals - bp, temp, pulse, respirations 
focused neuro exam - mental status, glasgow coma scale score, CN eval , strength/sensory test , deep tendon reflexes, coordination + gait 
concern for tmj = assess jaw openng, mastication muscle palpaton 
concern - CNS infection with neck examination to assess for meningeal irritation 

---
no imging for uncomplicated headache
don't do neuroimging in stable headaches that are migraines
no CT for headache except
