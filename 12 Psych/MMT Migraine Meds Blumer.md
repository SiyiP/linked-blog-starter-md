note - simple analgesics like acetaminophen, aspirin, caffeine and nsaids like ibuprofen, naproxen and ketorolac are all used for migraines and data for their use is good 

migraines - usually episodic, mod to severe pain, unilateral, pulsating and aggravated by light and physical activity 
- huge based on the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">trigeminal nerve and its distribution onto intracranial arteries</mark>
- releasing CGRP calcintonin gene related peptide, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">potent vasodilator... cuasing the persistent pain in migraine headaches,</mark>
- basically extravasation of plasma + plasma proteins <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">into perivascular space... causing pain with edema with mechanical stretching of the nociceptors of the dura.</mark>
- modulation of trigeminal nerve input comes from dorsal raphe  (serotonin NTs cell bodies), locus coeruleus (NE cell bodies), and raphe magnus 
- huge - alterations in 5-HT signalling is gue in preventing migraines. 
- selective agonists of which ones need to be used. 
	- 1b and 1D selective are triptans
	- 1f selective are ditans 
	- these will BOTH arrest nerve signalling by binding onto those 5-HT receptors, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">stopping the release or decreasing release of CGRP and substance P into the cerebral arteries , limiting vasodilation</mark> 
- dopamine - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">also invoolved, dopaminergic stimulation would induce migraine symptoms wiht migraine sufferers having dopamine receptor hypersensitivity: **yawning, n/v and hypotension!!!**</mark>
	- therefore dopamine antags are good for this 

acute migraine attacks 
- most cases we can get oral agents and stuff unless we got n/v
- then we get iv/parenteral therapy 
- earlier treatment = earliier we can abort migraine in general 
- NSAID/Acetaminophen - fairly effective but suboptmal in mod/severe attaks... 
	- most effective taken early 

triptans - bind to 5-HT 1b/1d receptors - first line!!! 
- these recptors are in the cerebral + meningeal vessels mediating vasoconstriction. blocking release of CGRP and substance P 
- and the vasoconstrictoor properties  of these 2 receptors will prevent vasodilation and stretching of pain endings 
- these are presynaptic ones. blocking neuropeptide releases (CGRPs for instance)
- might be trial and error tbh , differs in pharmacokinetics. used to treat active headaches. 
- AEs: altered sensations, paresthesias, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pressure/tightness/pain in chest due to vasospasm in coronary </mark>, association with rare but significant Cardiac events , seen <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">htn</mark> in ppl with bp problems. maybe serotonin syndrome but not high risk 
- CI - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">no use in ischemic carciac, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular syndromes!!!! or htn !!!!</mark>
1. ergotamine
	1. not rlly triptans but ergot alkaloids.... will bind 1b and 1d receptors as well as 5-HT2 .... <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">many different receptor binding, powerful and long lasting vasoconstrictor.</mark>
	2. very effective. -
	3. AEs: ischemia, n/v , etc.... but also pregnancy, peripheral vascu dz, etc. 
2. sumatriptan 
	1. first one given , fastest time to peak levels but shortest half life!!!
	2. many diff preps of this like iv too. 
	3. more high AE spikes 

ditans 5-HT1F agonists - more selective , newer 
- 1F = are in the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CNS and peripheral NS but NOT in the vasculature!!! safe for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease patietns!!!</mark>
- AEs: - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">driving impairment</mark> due to dizziness for at least 8 hrs after each dose. 
1. lasmiditan 

CGRP receptor antagonists
- targetting the CGRPs -gepants drug 
1. rimegepant
	1. this is like a small molecule that blocks the CGRP receptor. 
	2. acute treatment **and prophylaxis approved**
	3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">good when can't handle triptans!</mark> - same efficacy as these ... with fewer AEs. but expensive /: 
2. erenumab 
	1. these are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">monoclonal antibodies binding to the RECEPTOR!!!!!!</mark>
	2. binding to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">extracellular domain of the CGRP receptor</mark>
	3. used for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">prevention/prophylaxis</mark>
	4. only a subq injection monthly .... well tolerated but expensive yayy

dopamine receptor antagonists - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">good for nausea</mark>; good for acute migraine attacks
- reduce both migrain headache pain + reducing nv which will accompany migraines. 
1. metoclopramide
	1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">D2 receptor AND 5HT3 antagon</mark>ist
	2. will reduce n/v 
	3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inc lower esophageal sphincter tone, enhancing gastric emptying, reducing n/v</mark>
	4. prokinetic drug!!! 
	5. AEs: 
		1. extrapyramidal effects anytime u block D2 receptor blockage!!!!
		2. dystonic rxns, movement disorders, tardive dyskinesia , tortillicus ; these are like long term things 
		3. hyperprolactinemia ; due to D2 regularly blocking prolactin reelase 
2. prochlorperazine - blocking D2 receptors AND <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">histamine receptors</mark>
	1. typically 1st gen antipsychotics 
	2. can be for n/v severe + sedating 
	3. AEs: 
		1. extrapyramidal effects anytime u block D2 receptor blockage!!!!
		2. dystonic rxns, movement disorders, tardive dyskinesia , tortillicus ; these are like long term things 
		3. hyperprolactinemia ; due to D2 regularly blocking prolactin reelase 

prophylaxis 
1. topiramate
	1. inhibits <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">voltage gated na+ channel by extending inactivated state of the channel, limiting high frq firing of APs, GABA metabolism, and carbonic anhydrase inhibition</mark>
	2. recall this is antiseizure med - 
2. valproate
	1. also <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inhibits voltage gated Na+ by limiting high freq firing of ap, reduing t-type ca2+ currents + limits sustained repetitive firing, maybe inc GABA lvls too</mark>
	2. look over antiseizure med again [[MMT Anti-Seizure Medications_Blumer]]
3. propanolol beta blocker
	1. good for preventing migraines - treating hypertension 
	2. cross the BBB 
	3. will take up to 3 mon to work 
	4. good to protect against htn but not for stroke 
	5. any type of CV stuff = steer away rom this 
4. arbs  = like candesartan 
	1. well tolerated but not in pregnancy 
5. amitriptyline TCA... 
	1. only tca effective
	2. blocking SERT and NET to block reuptake of 5-HT and NE 
	3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">same MOA as SNRIs.... and recall SNRIs are also used for migraine prophylaxis. </mark>
	4. TCAs - look into antidepressants lecture, fatal in od and serotonin syndrome [[MMT Antidepressants Blumer]]
6. botulinum toxin A 
	1. good to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">chronic treatment </mark>of migrains ; <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">15+ migraine days a month </mark>
	2. cleaves c-term of SNAP-25 which blocks docking of NT vesicles... <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">blockign the release of inflammatory neuropeptides ... given in temples, nose, neck, back of head etc.</mark>
	3. AEs: dysphagia, muscle weakness, headache, etc... these can all be well tolerated 
7. Mg = effective supplement? 
8. coQ10 and riboflavin - some evidence in prevention?
