cognitive+emo dysfunctions co occur with metabolic disorder like obesity + poor dietary habits etc. multifactorial 
- inflammation/inflammatory response
- halthy eating patterns reduce inflammation, and will help brain function improve and stave off dementia
- stave off cog decline
	-  we can prevent:obesity , htn, high cholesterol, dm2 etc. etc 
nutrition - most are observational studies which conflict. decide what to do yourself. there's some summary articles + conflicting outcomes 
- we can make sure we have healthy dietary pattern
-  o3 intake/fish consumption 
- .b vitamins
- vita d
- reduce ox stress
- antioxidants
- reduce alc intake 
- inc polyphenol intakes
- all dietary factors = modifiable 

limiits - only observational, no long term follow up, limiited in age populations, no knowledge of a lot of conflating factors etc. 
- replication of findings across popualtions is a huge thing tooo 
- need more markers to study. 

can dietary patterns impact cognitive decline/dementia
- mediterranean diet
	- intake f monounsaturated fat + fruit + veg, plant proteins, whole grains + fish. 
	- reduce heart dz, htn, etc. 
	- helps metabolic syndromes other things associated with cog decline
	- metabolic control is huge 
	- oxidative stress is reduced, delayed in some dementias
	- higher blood o3 fatty acids can slow cognitive decline
- DASH diet - low salt, low sodium, portion size is hgue
	- lower bp, lipids, cholesterol + chronic dz
- MIND diet - combo of the two for neurodegen delay!!
	- vegs, whole grains, daily wine??? bruh lmao 
	- combo = reduced alz dz. 
no single food best for brain health but food groups in healthy pattern = best


fish + seafood - omega-3 fatty acids
- high fish = inverse association with cog decline
- at least eat this like 1x a week 
fruits/veg
- variety is best and good for ppl in cog function. 
- prodom in older populations = the studies
Nuts/seeds
- good soruces of vitamin E, B6, fibers, and ther phytonutrients
- follows thru with this - better scores on recall and other cog testing 
- NURSES health study - higher scores but not asociated with the rate of chnage of cog decline

macronutrients
- proteins - and amino acids - help with making some neurotransmitters like catecholamines + serotonin 
	- malnutrition = bad outcomes in older adult population 
- fats = rodent studies shown cog effects of long term high fat. healthy fats omega3 is benefitial 
- carbs - for brain funtion with glucose. cog fatigue due to decline in neuronal glucose utilization. 

micronutrients
- omega3 - long chain polyunsat fatty acids - help against chronic decline
	- start these earlier onset .... don't wait until onset of symptoms. 
- b vitamines - folate, b12, b6 
	- will impact homocysteine levels = this is how we measure
	- highest homocysteien in plastma = higher incidence of dementia
	- B12 and homocysteine = B12 will <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">lower homocysteine</mark>
	- note - some exposure to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">high lvls of folic acid = accelerates the nerve dmg</mark>
- antioxidants - reduc ox dmg
	- Vitamin C + e + polyphenols, sylinium and copper etc. 
	- with some vita e = the type is important. high alpha form vitamin E + gamma form vitamin E = effective but otherwise not
	- competing info on whether it's important 
- flavonoids- natural substances in fruits, vegg, grain, bark, roots, stems, flower, tea + wine 
	- wine and tea!! and fruit + vegs 
	- growing evidence of prtection 
	- coca? enhanced hippocampal vascular plasticity + cog function in older adults
- vitamin D 
	- prevention of neurological, autoimmune, and psychiatric dz, 
	- know = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">having a higher level of vitamin D is more associated with decreased dementia developping; and vitamin d below 25 mmol / l = significant decline over time.</mark>
	- those ppl are inside most of the time, u need to go outside!!!
	- just need to reach adequate status

don't rec supplementation for brain health!!!!
- best evidence - vitamins + minerals thru ur dietary stuff
- exceptions vitamin d in homebounds + B12 supplementation in older adults

Smart food stuff ofc. myplate for older adults!!!!!

don't memorize it - but with dementia 
- maintain weight reasonably 
- sufficient kilocals
- finger foods
- creative feeding techniques
- independence,
- minimize choking
- verbal chewing stuff

nutrition therapy for psych disorders.
- inc / dec in appetite - figure out why - think of the meds they're on 
- inc/dec activity levl
- use of meds 

also anxiety
- idk lavendar lmao and other things 
- root cause,
- med management
- lifestyle
- DASH/Mediterranian too
