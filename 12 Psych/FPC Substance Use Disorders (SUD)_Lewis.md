misuse of substances

---
adolescent high potency cannabis use - huge risk factor of young adult psychatric cnditions 

sud 
- alc is number one bc culture and bc of legality , normalization 
- no safe amount of alcohol - reframe how we think about it - only lw and high risk 
- ppl can have a bad outcome even if they don't have addiction and don't drink = a reminder that there's no zero risk use. 

dsm-5-TR = 10 classes of drugs
- alc
- caffeine
- cannabis 
- hallucinogens
- inhalents,
- opioid
- sedatives/hypno/anxiolytics
- stimulants
- tobacco
- other/uknown 

2 categories

		- usng larger amts for longer than inended
		- persistent desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut odwn 
		- large amt of time given towards it 
		- craving 
	- social impairment = really starts to fall apart

		- persistent social/interpersonal problems
		- giving up on those things 
	- risky use
		- use in physically hazardous situations 
		- use despite physical or pyschological problems caused by use 
	- pharmacological criteria (appropriate medical treatment exclusion)
		- tolerance; to benzo and other things for isntance. we need more and more to have a similar effect. 
		- withdrawal
	- must have 2+ criteria
- substance induced disorders
	- intox 
	- withdrawal; detox off cocaine or something severe suicidal affect. 
	- substance/med-induced mental illness

severity specifiers
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">mild = 2-3</mark> symptoms
- mod = 4-5 
- severe 6+ symptoms 
course
- early remission <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">more than 3-12 mon</mark>
- sustained remission 12+ mon 
- on maintenance therapy suboxone or methadone 
- in controlled environment 

use person-centered language - saying they suffer from addiciton or sud, 
don't use clean or dirty, and instead of relapse or lapse say "resumed or recurrence of symptoms"

abuse -> use/misuse
sober -> abstinent 
dug habig -> SUD
ivdu -> pwid ; person with intervenous drug use 
diversion -> non-prescribed use
recovering alc -> prson in recovery from aud
medication assisted tx -> medications for addiction tx 
relapse -> recurrence of symptoms 


screening
- how many times in past yr have u used an illegal drug or used a prescription medication for nonmedical reasons? 
- formal screens - audit-c, dast, craftt
- all addictions are like avoidance of discomfort, and an attempt to use something to help 

hx taking- ask abt their

	- freq of use
		- daily or binge pattern?
	- method of use
		- orally, inhalation, insufflation(snorting), IV -(in hep c, abscesses , endocarditis, scarring), and skin popping, rectal, etc. 
	- duration of use 
		- 1 mon? 2 yrs?
	- periods of sobriety
	- problems with withdrawal 
		- avh or seizures
