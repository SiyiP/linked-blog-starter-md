#psych 
this is a more structured categories of dx - 
around obv testble structures 

--- 
anxiety = expected normal response to stress , usually transietn can be for survival but can become pathologic when it goes beyond helping out and just hurts 
- **fear (immediate, known) v anxiety** 
- **known v unknown** 
- immediate vs insidious
anxiety - optimal = medium stress is good with best performanc
disorganization = high stress, more stress than anxiety and perforamnce is lower. 


manifestation 
- fight v flight
- autnoonomic hyperactivity 
- affective
- behavior = avoidance, compulsions, etc
- ntrusive thoguths = getting in way of fears coming true? idk 
cycle of anxiety 
1. trigger
2. thoughts 
3. anxiety 
4. beliefs are formed and perpetruate the cycle 

anxiety = pathologic stress reuslting in missed work and social things
- most common psych d/o 1/3 of ppl 

case presentation 
case 1 
- 35 yoo man no hx, gonna fly, missed many fam events, lost his job due to refusal to travel 
1. 	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">specific phobia of flying, recognizes fear is persistent + unreasonable</mark>
	- occupational + social interference
	- fear is persistent + lasts 6+ mons 
	- many diff types 

case 2 
- 32 yo female schoolteacher - freezes up when teaching + forgets lesson plasn 
- appetite impaired
- embarressed at party 
	1.  social anxiety disorder = marked of persistent fear of 1+ situations that involve social interactions/performance
	- fears <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">embarrassment/humiliations, involving exposure to unfamililar ppl or being scrutinized</mark>
	- exposure to the situation -> anxiety and so situations are avoided
	- person recognizes fear is excessive, and it's 6+ months 
	- functioning impacted significanty 
		- might see amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex is hypersensitive 
		- we see maybe some aspects that accidentally deine something as pain when it's not 
case 3 - excessive worrying after children moved to college
- worrying abt her house when away even when safe neightborhood
- - difficulty concentrating, poor sleep , restless + fatigue 
1. generalized anxiety dz - excessive anxiety or worry abt MULTIPLE events/activities , 6 mon most days 
	1. cannoot control worry - flight of worries
	2. anxiety is persistent, 3/6 associated symptomes = restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, sleep issues 
	3. GAD 7 = way of severity scale , 0-3 as 0. = non at all, 3 = nearly every day 
		1. feeling nervous, anxious oneduge
		2. not able to stop or control
		3. worryign too much abt diff things
		4. trouble relaxing
		5. restless, can't sit still
		6. easily annoyed/irritable
		7. feeling afraid as if something awful might happen 


case 4 
- chest pain, sob, heart racing 
- new job after multiple eps a few times a week
1. panic disorder
	1. panic attacks = discrete period of intense anxiety 10-30 min, abrupt, subside slowly 
		1. palpitations, chest pain, sweating, shaking, sob, choking, n , dizziness, fear of losing control or dying 
		2. this is recurrent panic attacks
		3.<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> 1 mon or more of </mark>
			1. concern over having recurrent attacks
			2. worry abt implications of attacks
			3. significant change in behavior + loss of function 
2. agoraphobia - fear of public spaces
	1. public transort, 
	2. open spaces
	3. enclosed spaces
	4. crowds
	5. being out alone
	6. 6 mon + 

case 5 
- hard to get out of house, rechecking locks and stuff
1. obsessive compulsive disorder, obsession with safety of home, compulsion is locking 
	1. hoarding, trichotillomania, exriation disorder, body dyspmorhpic disorder, etc. all under this 
	2. a lot of treatment-resistant stuff. huge spectrum 
	3. spending <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">more than 1 hour a day</mark> = intefere significantly with functions 
	4. use YBOCS to monitor symptoms scale 
	5. note - neuroanatomy!!!
		1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anterior cingulate cortex is most consistent marker for mental illness = abnormalities of orbital frontal cortex, low levels of serotonin etc.</mark>
		2. problem detection -> cingulate gyrus for solution -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">in non-OCD ppl moving to the caudate nucleus to see move on/gearshift of moving on from problem</mark>
		3. in OCD, you just loop back from cingulate gyrus to orbital frotnal cortex!
2. obsessions criteria
	1. recurrent, intrusive, unwanted thoughts
	2. fear of contamination, thoguhts of death/killing
	3. pt knows it's from their own mind
	4. try to ignore, suppress or undo thoughts
3. compulsions
	1. repetitive behaviors/acts
	2. driven to do these
	3. reduce distress of obsessions attempt
	4. time cosuming/debiliitating 
4. hoarding disorder - persistent difficulty discarding stuff - disordered and compromises living space
5. trichotillomania - hair loss pulling hairball
6. excoriation disorder - skin picking, unsuccessful attempts to stop... make sure to rule out other causes
7. BDD - preoccupation with one or more aspects of one's appearance, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">flaw not observable to others as much...</mark> . clinically significant distress/impairment
	1. rule out eating disorders 



case 6 
after assault and mug outside, episodes of trauma
1. ptsd
	1. occurs in wake of exposure to significantly stressful event 
	2. life or limb is threatened or witness
	3. subjejctive and 2nd hand sometimes
	4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">can be called thi safter 30 days... before 30 days it's acute stress disorder </mark>
		1. 9/14 symptoms of ptsd liist 
		2. gtta be more than 3 days up to 30 
	5. repeated traumas >>> risk of ptsd 
	6. also includes repeated exposure to aversive details of traumatic events 
	7. stress = instrusive symptoms 
		1. recurrent, intrusive, distressing memories
		2. dreams/nightmares
		3. flashbacks
		4. intense distress when exposed to cues
		5. physiologic rxns to cues
		6. avoidance - avoidance or efforts to avoid these, and ppl or locations related to it 
		7. mood and cognitive symptomes
			1. inability to recall imprtant aspects of these
			2. neg thoughts abt self, others, world 
			3. distorted thougths ab cause/consequences
			4. neg emotions
			5. dimiinished intrerest in activities
			6. inability to experience poz emotions 
		8. arousal/reactivity symptoms 
			1. irritability, anger, aggressin, reckless behaviors 
2. adjustment disorder - emotional or behavioral symptoms <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">occuring within 3 mon </mark>of an identifiable stressor = can be like a breakup 
	1. distress out of proportion t stressor
	2. clinically significant impairment 
	3. does't meet criteria for another disorder
	4. resolve in 6 months post removal of stressor

neuroanatomy of anxiety 
deep structures of brain, limbic system - survival behaviors
frontal lobes = thoughts 
- stimuli go into the thalamus 
	- then go right to fight or flight
	- or to the higher order thinking frontal lobes 
	- anxiety disorder bypasses that frontal lobe! cannot rationalize it thru 
	- shortcut = straight to emotion and the belief that you will die!!
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">maybe going thru the caudate automatic thoughts and then cause that stress</mark>
- in some cases chronic stress = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hypothalamic activation = additional pituitary rsponse, more adrenal cortical stimulation, just a type of this</mark>

TREATMENTS of anxiety 
- therapy - needs to get this!! cognitve and or behaviooral 
	- cbt is gold std for all anxiety dz 
	- how do emotions, behavior and thoughts all influence each other... 
	- exposure therapy for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">specific phobia + ocd = exposure + response prevention or ERP</mark>
	- for PTSD = eye movement desensitization and reprocessing
- medications
	- antidepressants = SSRIs/SNRIs/others
	- benzodiazepines - just reduce some symptoms 
	- propranolol, buspirone, gabapentin - blutning sympathetic surge
- neurosurgery sometimes 
	- in severe cases 
	- anterior capsulotomy - removing part of the anterior cingulate 
	- gamma knife with this too 

in GAD, specific phobia, panic dz
- ssri/snri
tca = clomipranmine for OCD
beta blockers = specific phobias 
benzodiazepines = panic disorder but makes general anxiety disorder worse /: not getting to the root of stuff

TMS transcranial magnetic stimulation to intervene iwth the brains
- has a coil for ocd to break them out the thoughts
- deploy ERP in the moment and then get them to see
- can help with OCd specifically 
- this would augment the specific parts you need
