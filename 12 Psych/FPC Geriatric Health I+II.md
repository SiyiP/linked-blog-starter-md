our population of older adults grow more and more 
comprehensive geriatiric assessment
- we need more broad multifacited aprpoach and need to use more time to dhelve into this stuff
- addressing moving about the house, bathing, dressing, toileting = ADLs
- instrumental = cooking, cleaning, yardwork etc. 
- succeess based on communication with older adults
- need pysical therapists, geriatrition, community health worker too 
- pharmd = complete med reconciliation with patient + caregiver, look into beers criteria esp look into anticholinergic risks
- pt eval too about fall risk 
- Social worker. - respite care for the caregiver themselves and id any social needs
- optometry - vision test, assess for fall risk vision impairment 
- audiology - vestibular dysfuntion is huge fall risk too. 
	- hearing loss = connection to memory impairment. 

use well lit room, direct face, speak slowly, minimize noise, consider hearing deficits, qs in large print, minimize interruptins, allow time, 

4 Ms!!!= 4 piece approach to older patients 
- mind = any cognitive issues?/  mood stuff 
	- - mentation - screen for memory impairment. - 
	- use MCOG = minicog 3 word recall and a clock drawing test
	- MOCA - 30 point questionnaire= diff areas of cognititon to repeat and look at over time 
	- VA gives a slums exam etc. 
	- mmse - another 30 pitn memory tool - reitnation,attention, lang etc. 
	- delirium can be seen = alteration in mental status, acute change 
		- acute change in metnal status? 
		- inattention 
		- altered lvl of consciousness 
		- showing disorganized thinking - will a stone sink or float in water? 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pseudodementia</mark> = slowed cognitiion from potentially reversible conditions like depression/delirum. use phq-9 or ghs for depression  and CAM for delirium 
	- during <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">annual visit. - get a baseline on primary care thing .... if concerns brought up by family and monitor over time</mark>
	- moood = with depresson/anxey? PH2 / PH9 and geriatric depression scale 
- mobility = movement/fall risks 
	- falls leading cause of unintentional injury 
	- old age, cog impairment, **functional** **impairment**, impaired moblity 
	- ADLs 
	- iADL = driving, housework, meals, etc. 
	- screen for falls = use <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">time timed up and go? most consideration of fall risk = hx of falls</mark>
		- activity of faller at the time
		- prodromal lightheadness, imbalance, dizziness, 
		- lcoation/timing
		- consciousness loss
		- underying chronic dz; like perihperal neuropathy with diabetes , hearing , 
		- medications
		- social hx - alc/environmental factors; shoes and stuff have good tred
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">timed up and go = </mark> test where we see starting from chair and walking a line 10 ft away. if 12+ seconds = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inc fall risk, need pt benefits</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">gait speed = strongest predictor of future disability + death + </mark> most effective frailty screen!!
		- gait speed .8 m/s = independent ambulation 
		- .6 m/s = community activity without chair
	- grip strength test - mobility, strength of lower extremities + balance, another fraility test 
- medications = polypharmacy and id-ing things they might not need anymore
	- med reconcillition - making most accurae list of possible of all meds they're taking include supplements
	- **compare list after recent hospital admission, drs. office or new med adjustments**
	- bring bottles to office 
	- key compoentns - what med, dose, how often, when, instructions? what is it for and why, cost issue, organize how? do you ever foget? etc. 
	- pill reminders = pillbox = giving reminder to pt or caretakers. some are outta pocket. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">start low go slow for older patients. titrate upward slowly as tolerated + avoid starting 2 drugs at same time </mark>
	- prescribing cascade might give too many, 2nd med treats the SE of first med which is ?? bruh 
	- fall risk increasing drugs = FRIDS= beer's criteria 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">deprescribing = medstopper.com, deprescirbing.org, and ags choosing wisely.</mark>

- M= what matters most to you? advance care planning 
	- patientprioritiescare.org 
	- id what matters most, health outcomes goals align with their goals and healthcare prefrences. 
	- living will - most very specific uncommon clinica scenario 
	- healthcare prxy - power of attorney - who will make my decisions
	- advance care plan - most comprehensive, 5 wishes - what they want at the end of life. including wishes
	- medical orders - POST form (filled out and put on the wall wishes on code status and stuff) - DNI/DNR as well 

nutrition - unintentional loss of weight in 6 mon? getting to nutritionist 


take home - 
- multimodal + complex 
- 4 ms framework is easy to rremembe r the approach

geriatric syndromes
- frailty - chronic aging of body, dysregulation of energetics + multiple systems
	- severe frailty - irreversible, pre death phase 
	- earlier phases - might be responsive to treatment 
	- this  is impactful for outcomes in many diff med conditions ; predictor of surgical outcomes for ex - like in patient setting research 
	- frail older adults = less toleratnt of stressors, delay recover, high fall risk, worse outcomes in hospitals. 
	- aging + homeostasis 
		- chronological is not biological 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">homeostenosis = as cell aging happens, there's les sphysiologic reserve to deal with challenges to homeostasis</mark> = more vulnerability to disease 
	- trajectory for frailty states after stressor 
		- frail has more significant functional stress... then back to baseline that's not the same as before
		- very frail - progressive decline post-insult 
- categories of fraility 
	- look into functional things like ADLs
	- phsyical like grip strength 
		- weight loss, exhaustion, slowness? low activity level , weakness
		- like timed up and go 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">gait speed is most effective screen for frailty</mark>
	- cliniical frality scale 
	- 1-9 and 9 being terminally ill and 1 = very fit 
		- 4 is vulnerable and on the cusp of getting frail, doesn't have anyone helping yet 
		- 5 = now IADLs need help and slowing 
		- **6 = ADLs and IADLs affected. start to have really poor outcomes**
		- 7 = 24/7 care but not near end of life
		- 8 = near end of life , need help with everything 
		- 9 = dying actively 
		- think = 1-4 able to go outside independently 
		- 5-9 indoor 
- MANAGE IT;
	- avoid immobility 
	- treat depression 
	- social support improvements
	- min polypharmacy 
	- aerobic + strenghtening exrecise
	- tai chi 
	- nutritional support with mediterranian diet and above 

preventative screenings - older ppl should get preventative health measures 
- few things help 
- harms of screening = anxiety, risk of infection from biopsies, prep complications for colonoscopy 
- think of timing vs cancers - do wewanna screen? downsides of it 
1. colorectal cancer screen 45-75 testing home based test or dna test. colonoscopy is golden std ... in 75-85 it's based ont he individual. no screening <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">beyond 85.</mark>
2. lung cancer - 50-80 and 20 yr pack hx, or quit in the past 15 yrs
	1. stop screen when hasn't smoked in 15 years... and life expectancy declined so that lung surgery on't be performed 
3. cervical cancer - pap smear 3 yrs or every 5 yrs if hpv tested
	1. stop afer 65 yrs if
		1. 3 consecutive neg cyto results
		2. 2 consecutive neg hpv results within 10 yrs be4, wth most recent one within 5 years
		3. or total hysto wth removal of cervix and no hx of cin grade2/3 or cancers 
4. prostate cancer
	1. possibility of false poz/biopsy harm = 55-69 yrs old 
	2. 70+ = screening not recommended 

eprognosis.ucsf.edu = risk benefit life expectancy tool - inputting data to see - compare benefit to the time - is it worth screenign fr?
