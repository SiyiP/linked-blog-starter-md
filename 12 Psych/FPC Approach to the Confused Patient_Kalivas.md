#psych 
case based kinda 

confusion - focal brain issue? whole brain probem?both? 
- either way somethings not working - yes probably at some tie 

acuity - when did it start? rapid onset or getting worse?
first presentation - ever happened prior 
level of arousal - are they sleepy ? 

case 1 
young man w/ no pmhx or pxych hx presents with subacute paranoia and bizarre behavior 
- pertnently - paranod delusions progressing over several weeks
- blistered feet walking fo long periods
- attention intct
- awake/alert
- given hx unclear 
make sure u get cbc and bmp and urine drug screen + alc level
chest xray bc of asthma 
blood gas 

young man with subacute dev of paranoid delusions with negative UDS (drug screeN) and largley normal labs 
diferntial 
- brief psychotic disrder
- bipolar
- chizophrenia
- substances induced by agent missed by uds 
- possible but less likely - 
- - nonconvulsive status epilepticus or paraneoplastic syndrome 
confused abt reality and classic presentation of psychotic disorder, high functionign then had decline

---
case 2 
family has captured her = paranoia
no pain 
not making much sense so fam hx 
2 days ago suddenly house was a mess then drty
- mild dementia 
- ckd stage 2 
- afib
- htn 
- donepezil for dementia  , asa , apixaban etc. 
- mild 
widowed, lives alone but fam in same neighborhood
- likes to read + tend to her garden 
85 yo with mild dementia presents with acute onset of altered mental status 
- confusion - impaired attention 
- acute <2 days
- hx of cog impairment 
- low bp and mild tachycardia 
cbc - leukocytosis 
bmp - mild hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis 
csf = normal 
urine - poz for nitrites, many wbcs, bacteria, ketone negative
urine blood drug screen = if they're confused get one. they are old and can do cocaine still .  
chest xray 
head ct - normal 
blood gas = normal 
no evidencee of stroke in mri 
- elderly woman with hx of cognitive impairment with acute worsening of mental status found to have uti and hyponatremia, concerning for delirium 
delirium - encephalopathy, acute confusional state, acute brain failure, icu psychosis
- acute fluctuation of mental status, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">disruption of attention and arousal </mark>
- not due to anything underlying 
- waxing and waning 
- why does this happen? 
	- system disintegration 
	- nodal circuits and theories begin to lose coplex cmmunication bt brain areas
	- many neurotransmitters at play 
symptoms
- delucions/paranoia 
- poor memory/amnesia 
- psychomotor changes - may appear anxious or depressed 
- emotional lability - might be porderline or bipolar
- altered sleep cycle 
- autonomic arousal/insability like tachycardia 
1. hyperactive delirium - scredning, raising hell all day. psychomotor agitation, hyperarousal, ez to dx
2. hypoactive - in bed all day low arousal, sleepy patient is sick patient, 
3. mixed - combo or flucuation of both 
dementia = chronic + progressive. 
- this is a big risk factor for delirium which is acute on chronic brain failure 
- delirium is acute in onset, caused by underlying condition 
- common up to 75% ICU patients screen poz for this!!! more common in elderly and in ppl who are healthy too 
	- but this significantly inc in morbidity + mrtality... loss of independence, cog impairment can happen afterwards.
	- some ppl lost independence ): 
	- sometimes never get back to normal. more likely to not go home. 
cuases of delirium = I watch death 
Infection/iatrogenic

Withrdrawal
acute metabolic
trauma
cns pathology
hypoxia

deficiencies
endocrine
aacute vascular 
toxins 
heavy metals 

how to eval the delirious pt
- start with ABCs - airways breathing circuilation 
- phys ex with vitals
- corollary hx - pt will give incoherent hx so gather from others
- review meds - often a cause or a contributer. 
	- this is a huge modifiable thing!!! look into this!!!
	- sensory impairment too - make sure their restraints aren't there
	- ICU unable to sleep?
	- optimize some things in their care!!
- get labs - cbc, bmp, urinalysis, urine drug screen, ck if nms suspected, considering blood cultures, lumbar puncture
- imging - cxray, ct of head
- eeg considerations, only confirms dx 
- consider the LP - invasive af 

management - treat underlying causes 
- environmental interventions - don't keep the room dark 
- mobility is huge - they need to walk to combat this 
- meds - reserving for treating behavioral symptoms associated with it

case 3 
- dabetes, cad, heart attack
- but is sleepy on 3day in hospital and can't wake up 
- somnolent 
- unable to access, very very sleepy 
- 65 yo man with CAD and diabetes admitted for NSTEMI s/p pci with acute onst of somnolence + confusoin 
this is all delirium - stat head CT 
- since he's on new blood thinners!!! 
- no acute bleeding
- review meds
	- he couldn't sleep so given benadryl + sedating mediations too
- plan - hold meds and then consider cxr and urinalaysiss
