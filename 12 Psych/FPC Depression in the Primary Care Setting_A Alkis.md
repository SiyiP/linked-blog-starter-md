- NE and inflammatory and genetics are huge 
behavioral pov - unehalthy lietstyle, choices, behavioral changes 
dimensional pov - temperament, personality structure
life story pov - trauma, life events, Childhood Adverse events

we need to look at biopsychosocial model of all these things 

epidemiology - avg age onset is 20s altho 2nd peak in50s
- lifetime prev rate is 17% for MDD
- female more than male 
- RFs hx of ACEs, trauma, fam hx, chronic medical conditions
- comorbidieis - with SUD, anxiety, psychotic dz, 
- other - postpartum, prior hx of depression 
note
- men less likely to seek treatment
- children/elderly = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">more present with complaints of irritablity instead</mark>
- women may have PMDD = mood changes w hormones 
	only condition - treat with ssri and experience immediate relief 

1. major depressive disorder
	1. 5 symptoms for 2 wks or more 
	2. one **must** be either: depressed mood and loss of interest/pleasure 
	3. AND sig E caps at least 4 from here

2. persistent depressive disorder = dysthymia 
- depressed mood mostly more days than not for at least 2 yrs but only 1 yr in kids
- pre**sence of 2+ depressive sympt**oms 
- chronic, smoldering type of depression part of persionality at this poit 
- treatment - with meds + psyhchotherapy = less responsive to treatment? 

case 3 
3. depressive dz due to antoher medical condition 
- address other morbidity for max treatment of this 
	- depressed mood/anhedonia
	- demoralization vs depression 
		- demoralization = a normal rxn 
		- depression = more common with depression = hopelessness, anhednia, worthlessness, psychomotor retardation, suicidal ideation 
	- need evidence from h+P or labs for diret pathophys consquence of another med condition = hypothyroid, stroke, seizures, cancer, b12 def, folic acid def, hiv 
	- treat the problem = symptomatically treat the pt if unsure. 

case 4
4. substance/med-induced depressive dz
	1. persistnt disturbance in mood
	2. evidence mood distrubance dev during <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">one month of substance intox or withdrawal</mark>
	3. attempt to tease out substance use + mood issues in time course
	4. abstinence +/- med too can help out

MSE of someone w/ depression 
- appearnce - poro eye contact
- speech slow monotne
- psychomotor retardation 
- depressed moood 
- constricted affect
- linear thought process maybe impoverished
- possible suidcidal intent, negative themes
- some impairment of memory/cncentration/jugement 

treatment of major depressoin 
- psychotherapy 
	- like supportive psychotherapy - being with them and supportin natural defense mech = like primary care provider gives 
	- CBT - focusing on cognitive distrtions, unhelpful thinking styles, automatic thougths 
	- adaptable for diff presentation s
- pharmacotherapy 
	- ssri, snris, atypical antidepressants, tcas, maois
		- 4-6 wks to response
	- ketamine 
		- fast response
- somatic therapies/brain stim 
	- Electroconvulsive therapy, vagal, nerve, transcranial mag stimulation, deep brain stim = usually rapid responses except not tms 
- light therapy if seasonal 
- augmentation = lithium, t3, atypical antipsychotics, mood stabilizers = 

primary care depression = 
- pros - good relationship, accessible , less stigma , where ppl go for treatment
	- 60% in the primary care setting, 79% of antidepressant prescriptions given from providers hwo aren't mental health providers. 64% of ppl who attempt suicide saw healthcare provider within previous 4 wks
	- we need to use collab care model - integrate it team of primary care provider , psych, behavioral health care manageer (interface with patient and pcp)
		- tracking patient with time 
		- tracking symptoms and helping them out in staff meeting
		- population based with screening models and databases. 
	- ned to listen, collateral info 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">routiney screen depression, mania, suicidal ideation</mark>
	- phq-2 and then ph1-9 and then ask asq, cssrs, mdq and rapid mood screener. 
- cons - not equipped for complex cases, limited support, don't get paid for xtra time, lmted training formally, less time!! 

bipolar disrder in primary care
- often first presents as depression 
- DIG FAST = mania/hypomania
- screen fam hx of bipolar in depressed patient
- mood disorder questionnaire + rapid mood screener 
- refer at first presentatin if needed - bipolar is hard to treat!
