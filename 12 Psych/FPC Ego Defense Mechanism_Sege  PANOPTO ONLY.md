#psych 
**recall the purpose of defense mechs as well as the mechs themselves** 
psychoanalysis + psychodynamic theory 
- ego + ego defense - mental basis of self, regulation of basic drives/sociocultural norms to maintain sel
- defense mechs - behaviors to sustain self stasis 
- transference - therapy in which client therapist transfers feelings onto the other
- resistance - in therapy by which client/therapist reacts gaainst the other in defense of self
- psychodynamic motivation - to maintain current self or adapt to healthier self 

modern psychoanalytic theory 
- persons' dev is determined by early + ongoing life exp + interaction
- human behavior + cognition largely determined by instinct/unconcscious drives
- mental disturbances like depression rooted in unresolved conflicts bt conscious + unconscious 
- attempts to bring such conflicts into awareness triggers resistance + use of defense mechanisms
- therapy brings about the poz change by bringing unconscious material into consciousness, understanding resistance, resolving conflict 


model of self 
- ego = reality principle = mediator between the two 
	- most likely us on the concous level. 
- superego= morality principle ; angel on the shoulder 
- id = pleasure ; the basic animal instincts = more unconscious

modern conflict theory 
- emphasizes conflict bt conscous + unconscious 
	- wishes
	- guilt/shamee
	- basic emotions = anxiety/depression 
	- defensive operations
- defense of self = major goal of the psyche 

ego defense mechanisms - engage in consciously or unconscously and can be good or bad. 
- to protect against anxiety and depression due to internal conflict 
- maintenance of self-stasis (current state of conscious-unconscious balance)
	- frued 10s - repression - keeping stuff that is unacceptable to conscious mind ): 
	- currently - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">true repressions are rare... sometimes false memories can be given to someone</mark>
	- suppression = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">motivated forgetting, rather than unconscious, but we consciously try to stop thinking a thought.... leads to decreased memory for unpleasant contents more often seen in healthy ppl!</mark>
		- this is helpful to put them off and not worry about ... sometimes there's pathlogical levels of this where you need to acutally process stuff
		- maybe some balance is needed with how much 
	- regression - going back to earlier stage of development than handling unacceptable impulses with maturity 
	- reaction formation - subconscious transfmation into true desires/feelings into the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">opposite</mark> to avoid that mood. basically coping. like self-reports on questionnaires of depression thing. 4 or 5 is normal... but 0 is not normal (appears as depressed)
	- isolation = separation of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">memory or thoguht from bothersome associated elements like emotions. seen in military ppl, will discuss trauma and events, and giving flat effect like court reporter.</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">undoing</mark> - try to<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> cancel out</mark> or remove threatening thought or impulse by engaging in the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">opposite</mark> behavior! seen in ocd thought neutralization = compulsions are done to cancel out something that they're anxious about 
	- projection = mistakenly interpreting what's inside from outside. 
		- immature - projecting one's own unacceptable thoughts/feels onto others
		- delusionoal - projecting internal concerns abt safety/integrity into external world like anxiety onto the world with delusional belief that you're getting gangstalked or something 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">introjection</mark> - subconscious adoption of thoughts or personality of person who s<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">eems more capable </mark>- liek effects of gaslighting onto a patient. causing person to introject due to lack of reality confidence
	- t<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">urning against self - nonsuicidal self injur</mark>y - coping/cathartic functions + motivated and/or impulsive behavior. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sublimation</mark> - transformation of<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> unacceptable urge into acceptable one. </mark>
- other defence mechs of gaillant classifications  (least to most helpful)
	1. level one <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">- pathological = delusional projection, turning against the self</mark>
		1. denial, distortion, conversion(expression of internal conflict as physical symptom), splitting (internal impulses separate from the self; this is a separate person from myself) are all new ones that fall into this 
		2. some are processes of psychosis sometimes... but we need to maek sure they're framed properly 
	2. immature = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">projection, introjection</mark>
		1. acting out - expressing unconscious wis/impulse in action 
		2. hypochondriasis
		3. passive-aggressive behavior
		4. antasy 
		5. idealization 
	3. neurotic -<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> rxn formation, repression, isolation, undoing</mark>
		1. intellectualization - concentrating on intellectual components of a situation to isolate... like a court reporter
		2. dissociation - temp detuning of identity to avoid extreme distress
		3. rationalization - telling self that no wrong has been done thru false reasoning 
		4. withdrawal - behavioral avoidance 
	4. mature - sublimation, suppression 
	-
anxiety - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">predominantly based on neurotic defences and sometimes immature defences</mark>
- primary conflict bt childhood ingrained sense of danger. + adult growth - need to defend unconscious fear impulses can feel protective

depression - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">reliant on immature defense mechanisms</mark>
- ambivalent early relations with love is a key progenitor of depression 
- much of treatment is focused on discoverign + processing early life rejection 

how to treat
- treatment focus - bring unconscious motivants + defense strats into consciousness
- assess bsed on projectivepersonality testing - rorschach + thematic apperception test
	- interpretation transferance - why do u react the way u do
	- analysis of resistance - whys's causing that discomfort

importance with resistance
- a leading evidence of key conflict - 
- diff schools all seek to promote client awareness
- not inconsistent with cognitive-behavioral approaches.
