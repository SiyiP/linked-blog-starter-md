mental illnesses/disorders are developmental 
uncinate fasciculus matures at 30 
brain doens't mature for 25-30 yrs. 
- some are especially vulnerable for some phases 

neuropsych disorders - hard to study, complex diseases. 
- genetic component (polygenic) = collection of different genes 
- also environmental factors can make these emerge. 
- burden to individual + society is huge 

cognition/cortex - many disorders stem from **deficits in cognition, whic is a collection of functions which enable us to attend internal/external stimulii, identify their significance + execute actions in response.**

where does this happen - 
- association cortices
	- blue = everything that's not a primary region. 
	- the areas which are really expanded in humans are here!! evolutonallry expanded areas in our neocortex
	- most of our brain is dedicated to this 
	- 
- these regions are special bc cognition is based on info integration from other regions
- these places are highly <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">interconnected</mark>, esp with other cortical regions 
- cortico-cortical connectivity - how diff areas talk to each other - mediated by this 

aspects are computed in certain regions but expression of this is relies on parallel/distributed processing of cognitive info 
"higher cortical regions"
- we have a hiearchy in our cortex, depends on how information flows. 
- cortex - is in layers if you recall

cortical layers - 
- normally info in cortex comes from lower hierarchy cortical regions (like the thalamus), -> layer 4 
- then from layer 4, it propogates to other layers, such as upper layers
- in upper layers, it can then go to another cortical region, which gets processed and then moves BACK to the cortical region at first
- then goes layer 5, then layer 6, and gets sent out somewhere else sometime. 
it gets sent to cortical regions which can do more and more complex processing. 

ex of visual field Activity Flow 
visual info --> LGN thalamus -> V1 primary visual cortex (elements of visual field), then V2(lines and edges received, and starts to make more complex shapes), V4(objects), and eventually IT (neurons which represent individual faces)
- processing will start in primary sensory region, then unimodal + heteromodal sensory + motor regions, and ends with primary motor regions. 
- also it can be *bi-directional!* called feed-forward or bottom up and top down aka feedback 
- higher order regions will shape how primary regions process *relevant information = this is top-down feedback.*
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">association cortices don't process sensory information but they interpret this information. v1 processes the sensory information</mark>
	- instead they interpret this information + associate pov + previous expreiences and access memory 
	- focus info on relevant information with top-down/feedback
	- drive meaningful action 

association cortices - what + where? 
- over temporal, parietal , frontal lobes
- unimodal association - integrate info from **single sensory modality**
	- like visual association cortex integrate info abt form, color, motion, leading to neurons selectivly responding to more complex visual info like shapes 
- heteromodal sensory - integrate info from more than one sensory area 
	- stuff which integrates many senses,,, like the representaton and feeling of personal space
	- neurons will only fire when they see the reward, but only when it's within arm's reach for instance! is it worth reaching for or even conceptualizing? 
- heteromodal motor association areas - will wee prep motor things in response to salient/rewarding  sensory cues like food 
- large regions - like a mesoscale description of cortex 


cortical collab = visual cortex processing - why don't we see the same thing with the dress? much of that is interpolation 
- visual information + processing is not a passive thing 
- this happens across many areas 
- ventral (what) and dorsal (where) pathway 
	- ventral pathway - what we said before, with the information movning from simple to complex with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">recognition of complex feat, including objs + faces</mark>
	- dorsal. = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">information sent to parietal lobe, getting spatial org of feats in visual field!</mark>
		- this is the neurons less responsive to color but show firing patterns specific to motion + spatial location in the visual field features 
		- they care about capturing object movement and otherwise 
- the projections have involvement with the<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">prefrontal cortex</mark> - which is exec action planning inclusive of action inhibition and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">working memory, which is able to plan and execute even when stimuli aren't present anymore</mark>

how is this solved or put together really in the brain - this is known as a binding problem + is an ongoing investigation 


we mainly use animal models nowadays like mice 
use of in vivo imging, recording, manipulation techs in humans
- fMRI, PET< EEG, TMS, electrophysiology in pts who've been prepped for brain surgery 

impairment
- association cortex lesions lead to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">agnosias</mark> = hard to perceive with normally functioning sensory channels otherwise 
- prosopagnosia - no face recognition 
	- lesions to the IT; inferior temporal cortex - response to complex visual stimuli or faces. 
	- might be able to recognize faces but can't apply it 
- simultagnosia - hard to process visuals as a whole
- akinetopsia - inability to perceive motion 
- hemiagnosia - contralateral neglect syndrome - lesion in right parieto-occipital region, neglect of L half of external space, forgets he his limbs 
most prom when lesions happen on the right side 
- R = processing both sides of body 
- L cortex - involved in processing r half of body 
- fail to report or orient or respond to stimuli on one side of body 
- neglect can manifest in many diff ways 


impairment of frontla lobe lesions ofc phineas gage - 
- prefrontal cortex 
- completely diff person 
- lateral prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex
- this part <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">assigns values and weighs consequences of future event to plan + org acctions, which is liek planning solutions to novel problems</mark>
- note - the sensory inputs + behavior will happn across various timescales - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">to bridge this, frontal cortex is also involved in working memory!!!</mark>
- type of memory used b4 tests 
- when tested, we see sustained activity of neurons across period of time until info can be used to plan + execute relevant motor plan 

prefrontal cortex will not be as active naymore - so no impulse control via inhibitory control over behavior
there's strong dopaminergic innervation which is impacted in addition + schizophrenia 

lesions to prefrontal cortex - dficits in tasks 
- tower of london test in testing the function in planning 
- wisconsin card sorting task - sorting the cards based on something like by color and shape. 
- lesions in it - problem with cog flex test 

cortex + languag
- lateralized system with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">left hemisphere semantic processing + motor commands + R in emotional/affective content</mark>
- sign lang cortical areas are the same
- these are higher order duh to integrate many modalities 
- ofc brocas - production of lang 
	- aphasia - can be motor or expressive 
- wernicke - understanding 
	- can be sensory or otherwise 
lesions -> aphasias 
conduction aphasia - connectiosn bt broca + wenicke is messed

split brain patients - lateralization of this with severing that corpus callosum as an older treatment for epilepsy 
- with that, we have L hemisphere  dominent for verbal rpocessing, but we can't see it if you show thi son their L visual field 
lang involves large parts beyond those areas - large variability
