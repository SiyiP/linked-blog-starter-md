these all inc lvl of da in the mesolimbic da system
- system originates in VTA, proecting to NaC, amygdala, hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex 

3 main moelcular mechnisms mainly 
1. class 1 = bind to g alpha I coupled gpcrs which inhibit GABAergic inhibitory interneurons thru disinhibition.... either by postsynaptic hyperpol via girk K+ or presynpaptic inhibition of GABA release
	1. basically disinhibition of DA happens, more DA is released 
	2. these re like MOR opioids, THC/cannabinoids CB1/2 and GHB 
2. class 2 = interact with ligand gated ion channels which directly stim DA neurons
	1. Benzodiazepines, ethanol, nicotine, pcp/ketamine
3. Class 3 - target the dopamine transporter DAT to interfere with DA reuptake 
	1. cocain
	2. amphetamines
	3. GHB 
[[MMT Opioid Analgesics_Blumer]]
drugs
1. heroin - a MOR agnist
	1. in the vta mor agonists inhibition of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, meaning disinhibition of DA neurons that project into NAc
	2. crosses BBB more than morphine !!!! -> 6-acetyl morphine active metaboltit is responsible 
	3. all these have strong tol + dependence, inc risk of addiction bc of bad withdrawal symptoms like dysporia, tachy, n/v, aches, lacimation, rhinorrhea, mydriasis, sweating, diarrhea, fever
	4. TREAT: for OD is naloxone but induce acute withdrawal
	5. MAT for OUD = methadone adminiistered daily , long acting mor agonist
	6. buprenorphine - long acting mor partial antag ; given as a buccal film strip ... coformulated with naloxone 
		1.<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> inclusion of naloxone prevents crushing that med for IV injection, blocking actions of buprenorphine </mark>
		recall how bad the oral bioaval of naloxone is... so if u try to crush buprenorphine as a powder to inject for a high only then it would work !!!!
2. sympathomimetics = cocaine
	1. blocks DAT, NET, SERT
	2. blocking <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">voltage gated sodium channels, good anestheticc</mark>
		1. ent local anesthetic properties <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">only one which prevents bleeding vasoconstrictor</mark>
	3. low oral bio, so it's snorted or injected iv ... 
	4. rapid onset of action; the alkaloidal form can be smoked , making a rush. 
	5. euphoria, alertness, wakefulness, arousal, motor performance, dec appettite, 
	6. SE: tachycar**dia, htn, mydriasis , sweating from NE!!!!**
	7. and OD: 
		1. cv overstim = arrhythmias, htn, tachypnea, hyperthermia , seizures, and psychosis via DA 
	8. withdrawal (not typically experienced) = dysphoria, fatigue, sleep disturbance, agitation, craving 
3. methamphetamine
	1. uses DAT/NET to enter the nerve terminal as well as tie up and compete with endogenous NE/DA for reentry, inc DA and NE extrasynpatic levels
	2. also <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">substrate for VMAT wich compete with NE/DA for uptake into vesicles, displacing NE/DA and inc intracellular levels of it too</mark>
	3. prevents packaging of these into the vesicles
	4. inside the cell, DA /NE will build up and then spit out , reversing the travel and pushes even more out. 
	5. weak mao inhibition = more intracllular DA/NE = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">efflux pump NET/DAT</mark>
	6. they have <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">good oral bioavailability and this one has a short half lif</mark>
	7. euphroia + alertness, bruxism, agitation, confusion 
	8. has greater <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">central efects than peripheral effects than amphetamine .... more readily pyrolyezed than it too</mark>
	9. Tox = neurotox, and other things like tachy/htn is less than that of cocain but still crisis 
4. MDMA - class of drugs from amphetamine !!
	1. similar to amphetamines - this causes release of biogenic amines by reversing action of transporters 
	2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">preferential afffinity for serotonin transporter SERT... most strongly inc the extracellular 5HT!!!</mark>
	3. fosters feelings of intimacy/empathy without impairing intellect...
	4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hyperthermia</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">serotonin</mark> syndrome. 
	5. chronically = neurotoxicity, but idk , withdrawal liek depression lasting up to several weeks 
5. GHB = gamma hydroxybutyrate
	1. made as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">product of gaba metbolsm but functional role uknonwn</mark>
	2. will bind to GABA-b receptor at low afffinity bnding site
	3. GABAnergic neurons more sensitive to GHB than dopaminergic neurons, so <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">selective ofor inhibitory gaba neurons</mark>
	4. similar to opioid effects?
	5. eurphoria, social closenes,s amnesia, sedation, coma at high doses. "date rape drug"
6. cannabinoids= THC
	1. we make our own endogenously - 2-AG and anandamide
	2. binding t CB1 and CB2 
	3. CB1 Receptors = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">on presynpatic nerve terminal, inhibit NT release in particular either one its on</mark>
	4. CB2r receptors = primarily in immune cels 
	5. THC delta 9 are found in marijuana alos <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">work thru CB1 receptors, making a lot of other effects.... inhibiting nt release</mark>
	6. similar to pioids, via presynpatic inhibition of GABergic neurons in the VTa, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">causing disinhibition of DA</mark>
	7. euphria, relaxation, inc appetite, hr, down is msucle coordination 
	8. conjunctival vascular engorgement, alleviation of minor pain 
	9. onset lasts for hrs 
	10. some therapeutic uses - appetite stim, supression of n/v, relief of chronic pain, for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">chemotherapy induced n/v and anorexia in pts with hiv/aids</mark>
	11. CBD. another component of it which is for seizures associated with dravet and lennox-gastaut syndrome [[SFP Introduction to Seizures and Epilepsy_Schmitt]] , <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">not psychoactive and doesn't interact with CB1</mark>
7. PCP phencyclidine 
	1. antagnizes NMDa like ketamine receptors
	2. inhibits DAT/SERT/NET,
	3. behavioral changes, htn, tachy, arrhtmias , <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">nystagmus, dec pain sensation, impulsivity, life threatening with seizures, miosis, hyperthermia, agitation, confusion, delirium, amnesia</mark>
	4. can easily hurt self 
	5. seizures, rhabdomylysis , trauma
	6. activated charcoal, gi lavage, benzos, supportive care.
