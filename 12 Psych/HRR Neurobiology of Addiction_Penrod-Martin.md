Substance use disorder - frameworks and stuff
often a coping strat and other things
- most ppl who have this will couse and they will typically meet criteria for another psych disorder too 

not every user advances to SUD 
OD rates and risks = many of these substances have these 
- these are cyclical with opioids then meth and then prior area cocaine 
not all ppl are impacte equally - not a moral failing but a brain disease 
cocaine in black population , meth in white population and opiids 

if diff groups have higher risk of SUD consider that when looking at patients

factors of SUD susceptibility 
- genetic predispo
- age of use onset... younger = more likely to addictive. basically cumulative repeated exposure 
- personal hx and personality traits
- availability 
- influence of family , friends, social structure (huge for resiliance towards SUD)
	- many treatments are focused on strenghtening these so that you get rewards that overpower the addiction 
- financial stability 

drugs of abuse cause maladaptive neuroplastic adaptations at the circuit, cellular and moelcular level 
- promoting continued drugs
- these chnages affect daily med treatments and veryyy individual 
- we need a large toolbox to impact patients across theiir whole cycle 

cycle 
1. binge/intox 
	1. drug consumption rewarding = cue-reward system
	2. the<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> basal ganglia </mark>, speicfically the striatum 
2. withdrawal/neg affect 
	1. negative impact or physical states due to absence
	2. the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">extended amygdala</mark> = opponent process theory ... with repeated exposure, the peaks are lower and more blunted and troughs are really low 
3. preoccupation/anticipation = 
	1. seeking post abstinence 
	2. this is prefrontal cortex 
hard to stop it - this is a relapsing remitting dz 
- we have a lot of preoccupation/anticipation, a primed system where u see a bunhc of everyday life stuff that remind u of using like friend connections etc, susceptible to relapse 

drug reward associations = dopamine 
- key part of the binge intox maladaptive leearning phase 
- - mesocortical tract, comoing from the ventral tegmental ara to the prefrontal cortex
	- preoccupation/anticipiation phase 
- and the nucleus accumbens projectsion the nigrostriatal tracts
	- ventral striatum 
	- binge intox 
- and the projections to the amygdala which is the mesolimbic tract
	- negative aspect and withdrawal 
 so multiple projections frm the VTA ventral tegmental area .... out to these regions 
	 primary cell type of nucleus accumbens = medium spiny neuron 
	 all drugs will act in diff parts of the circuits but will cause inc dopamine 
 these 3 substrates are ALL getting dopamine going there
 dopamine is huge for reinforcing habitual behavior, pulling all those things to drugs and decreasing sensitivity and release towards nondrug beavior 
 - addictive drugs all release dopamine in the ventral and dorsal portions of the striatum 
 - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inc in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens are all common in the drug use.</mark>
	 - nuc accumbens = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">gateway bt limbic/motor functions, regulation of motivated behaviors</mark>
	 - driver of motivated behaviors 
 - this dopamine released is much larger than the other times non-drug stimuli are there. 
 - the head of the caudate = involved in habit formation after drug initiation 

![[mesolimbic dopa release drug site of action.png]]
- opiates = disinhibition of VTA neurons = can make t act even more strong, making more dopamine 
-  opiates + cannabinoids= enhanced cell response in the medium spiney neurons to dopamine 
- cocaine/amp = dopamine transporter either blcked reuptake or flipit into releasing a ton of it into synapse 
- nicotine - at glutaminergic inputs to make it more active of the VTA and the nucleus accumbes
- cannabinoids - regulate how dopamine regulated via reelease in the medium spiny neurons 

when ppl repeatedly engage in the drug state 
- every time u do it u will have dopamine spikes follwing the stimuli that predict the aware
- incentive salience
- all the cues that predict drug predictability and stuff more dopamine released JUST for the cues = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">makes addiction susceptibility rise!</mark>
- dopamine release will keep u addicted and relapsing 

ultimately seen in pet and neuroimging studies = 
- less dopa release to cues that don't predict drugs and stronger ones for drug cues specifically 
- huge incentive salience = more salient than other cues and other rewards 

withdrawal + neg affective state
- can be physiological like alc or emotional and psychlogical 
- some ppl need rehab under medical care bc of this 
- at that same time with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dec mesolimbic brain reward, we have INCREASED circuit stress activation in extended amygdala (stria terminalis, central amygdala, shell portion of nuc accumbens)</mark>

pos reinforcement - good things comes from taking this action 
- dopa inc with taking drugs 
neg reinforcement = relieving the neg stimulus =will result in inc chance of taking that action 
- strengthened with more exxposure!!! inc the negative state and then make the relief all that much better. 


extended amygdala 
- CRF cells = stress related hormone CRF
- CRF actvates interneuronos GABA-A which in turn activate GABA projecting neurons into the 
	- lateral hypothalamus (homeostasus/neuroendocrine)
	- VTA reinforcmenet and rewards
	- brainstem with NE coming back in, making stress response huge to that central amygdala
		- this has prjections to brainstem and otherwise. 

preoccupation/anticipation - drug seeking phase - craving
- abstinence - can be short and seeking driven by ngative state 
- executive function goes down too - becomign weakner and not able to control behavior
- dysreg of prefrontal cortex - this circuit is weaker
- prefrontal cortex release of glutamate will happen due too drug related cues, which would all project to:  
	- nucleus accumbens = activating medium spiny neurons in the absence of dopamine, wich will kick off craving 
	- dorsal striatum  = habit circuit amped up  
	- extended amygdala = stress response fed back 

drug-cue presentation - where glutamate gets activated into the drug circuit specifically maeks it win out cmpared to natural reward 

how to reset this circuit change? huge for clinical and research 

glutamatergic plasticity at the synaptic junction bt prefrontal cortex + nucleus accumbens
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">there's more glutamate released into the nuc accumbens as a result of drugs due to synaptic potentiation</mark>
	- expansion of dendritic spine .... - inc of size of the response. 
	- inc AMPA/NMDA ratio
	- astrocyte retraction + downregulation of GLT-1 = cannot clear out the glutamate as well!!! 
	- degradation of ECM via MMP2/9 = meaning we can expand the spine head 
- in this preocupation anticipation phase, inc glutamate activity in PFC to nuc accumbens  circuit 

hippocampus - spatial context + memory formation; <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">context, like at the bar</mark> 
amygdala = basolat portion = cue reward memory formation, engaged during drug seeking ; <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">lighter = cue</mark>
insula = homeostatic context <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">how good or bad do i feel inside?</mark>



neurobio in SUD of animals - self administration of drug via animals, they press the budden themselves, assssing endophenotypes like impulsvty, compulsivity, relapse models 
- rodents - show all 3 phases
- analogus brain structues
