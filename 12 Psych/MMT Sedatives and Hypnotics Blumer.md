#psych #pharm 
2 main classes
compare + contrast benzo + barbiturates
these are like for anxiety too 
benzos - like beta blockers sorta of the psych word
- diazepam, midazolam, alprazolam, lorazepam, flumazenil (antagonist)
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dose response curve of GABA-a is shifted to the left but the maximal effect of gABA doesn't increase.</mark>
- these <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">require pre-synaptic GABA release</mark> for their effects!!!!
- mainly used for acute anxiety + sleep disorders but also muscle relax, anti-convulsant, preop sedations 
	- for anticonvulsants - they cannot but used longterm but ust for preventing/aboolishing it - bc rapid tolerance 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">used for status epilepticus , IM lorazepam or IV diazepam preferred</mark>
- note - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the dose-response curves are more save, will plateau in terms of respiratory depressant risks with more dose. but just don't use with alc or any other depressant</mark>
- will induce <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">increased FREQUENCY of OPENING the channel.</mark>
- these will potentiate the GABAergic neurotransmission at all levels fof the CNS 
distinct subunits alpha of the GABA A receptor mediates selective actions of these drugs!!!!!!!! 
- alpha1 = sedation + hypnotic effects
	- similar effect to barbituates - they do prolong stage 2 sleep but typically at expense of REM sleep. just less than the barbs. 
	- they are also not inducers of microsomal enzymes!
	- therefore higher therapeutic index... but <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">use with extreme caution in copd + OSA!!! bc u can relax the upper airway muscles</mark>
	- in sedation it's usedd as pre-op sedative, maintains the patient airways too and helps out with that. 
		- note - can produce <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anterograde amnesia</mark> which is good in surgery 
- a2 + 3 = anxiolytic effects
	- very effective anti-anxiety short term in the limbic system. 
	- potential for dependence + use disorder. will reduce learning + cognitive bunting. and ataxia in elderly. 
- a5 = cognitive + motor effects
	- helps out against muscle spasms. but doses that can treat those will cause sedations and ataxia etc. 
	- causes sedations, limiting the use 
note - most benzos don't sufficiently select for these but some liek z-compounds somehwat select for a1 
- AEs - will be dependence, addicitn, diversion, additive with other cNS depressants, amnesia, fall risk, memory impairment, ataxia, etc. 
- withdrawal syndrome - many things including seizures 
- pregnancy risk: - D level bc cleft palate, relatively save 
- Bzs - metbolized by the cyp 3A4 and CYP 2C19
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">drugs that inhibit CYP 3A4 impacts the moa of these like erythromycin, ritonavir, ketoconazole, and grapefruit juic!</mark>
1. diazepam - long acitng prototype 
	1. known for anxiolytic effects
	2. IV treats status epilepticus 
	3. in minor procedures too 
	4. antispastic agents too 
	5. also long half life bc of a**ccumulation of active metabolites** 
2. lorazepam - medium acting - primarily seizures 
	1. treat status epilepticus 
3. alprazolam - anxiety short acting 
	1. panic disorder / agoraphobia
	2. highly addictive tho bc shorter acting. xanax. highly diverted + deaths ith alcohol 
4. midazolam - anxiety short acting ; preop sedations 
	1. very rapid onset + short duration 
	2. very preop 
5. flumazenil - the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">benzodiazepine antagonist</mark>
	- this is meant to reverse the sedative impact of BZs post anesthesia or OD
	- note **not used often bc it immediately precipitates withdrawal in chronic users:** -> SEIZURES!

non-benzo benzos? z-compounds; these are selective for a1 subunits of the GABA A receptor 
- these are Z-compound binding to the alpha 1 subunit of the GABA A receptor. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">exclusively used for sleep for this reason - sedative effects with elderly pts wayyy more sensitive to these.</mark>
	- never combine with alcohol or something else 
	- less likely to cause physical dependence but still be prone 
	- still bidning to same sites as BZs. 
1. zolpidem, short half life 
	1. shortens sleep latency , <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">preserving deep sleep stages 3 and little effect on REM</mark> = sleep architecture is more preserved
	2. minimal muscle relaxing or anticonvulsant effects
	3. high dose = higher incidence of n/v 
	4. relatively safe alone 
	5. flumazenil does reverse this too 
2.  eszopiclone- longer half life helpful for ppl for sleep maintenance more than falling asleep

barbiturates - mainly past but still tested today 
- phenobarbital, pentobarbital, thiopental ; all -al
- been around for decades. mainly used as anticonvulsants and induction for anesthesia; 
	- anticonvulsants - used prophylactically to prevent seizures like phenobarbital 
	- induction of sleep - we might see sleep superficially but different from the regular sleep
		- u spend way more time in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">stage 2 instead of actual restorative levels of sleep!</mark>
		- sleep architecture is modified. 
		- with chronic use - will see rebound insomnia, sleep is ultimately way worse now. 
- note - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fatal respiratory depression with OD, induction of drug-drug interactions</mark>, use dependence and withdrawal is life-threatening 
	- drug drug interactions... we see a lot of accelerated disappearance due to cyt p450 induction. like disappeared vitamin D + K, inc metabolism of steroids + bilirubin + OCPs and more. 
	- bleeding disorders too !!! <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inc porphyrin synthesis, so this is CI iin pts with AIP</mark>
	- prone to dependence so the margin of safety is reduced in the ppl with chronic use when it comes to respiratory illness
	- seizures happen with sudden withdrawal which is severe. 
- note - there's a relatively linear relation bt going up on dose + respiratory fatal depression 
	- normal doses will depress the neurogenic drive
	- note - hypoxic drive knocked out in high doses with aortic + carotid bodies which are  knocked out first
	- and then the backup chemoreceptor drive within the medullary centers sensitive to pH + pCO2 .... will see that the hypnotic doses depress CO2 drve to the extent that pCO2 is inc above normal .... ultimately next breath is not stimulated 
- site = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">GABAA ligand gated chloride channel, allosteric site, facilitating more and more Cl- ion channel conductance + inhibition generally, prolonging the opening time of the channel and enhancing the GABA binding + increase potency of the GABA</mark>
- increased <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">length of time the channel is open.</mark>
	- dose response curve of gaba <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">is shifted to the left!!!! and the maximal effect is up too meaning the s-shaped curve would be moved to the left AND the top will be higher.</mark> and they can also **directly** activate that channel at higher levels. 
- these can enhance GABA conductanc even in the absence of gaba - this is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">responsible for toxicity</mark>
1. phenobarbital - long acting, most common anticonvulsant
	1. slow onset, long duration 
	2. notorious inducer of microsomal enzymes  
2. pentobarbital - intermediate, seldom used but more common in preop sedation + seizures
	1. lethal injection 
3. thiopental - IV induction for gen anesthesia 
	1. speedy, highly lipid soluble, getting them rapidly 
	2. notoriously post op n/v, reflex tachycardia, etc. 
	3. need to support respiration afterwards - profound respiratory depressant.
	4. fall in BP + elevated HR.

5-HT1a partial agonist - partial antag 
- buspirone- think the S for serotonin 
- this is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">partial agonist , low efficacy and high afinity drug</mark>
	- basically you block this receptor slightly, allowing more serotonin to be released. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">more serotonin is released....</mark>
	- 5-HT1A receptors are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inhibitory presynaptic receptors, and their activation = decreased firing of 5-HT neurons!</mark>
	- there is no sedation 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">no sexual dysfunction</mark>
-  no sedation , no hypnotic, anticonvulsant, or muscle relaxant properties, safer for ppl who use alcohol 
- useful in GAD and anxiety, efficacy is a bit mid tho 
- AES: dizziness, light headedness, headache, dose dependent pupillary constriction 
---

hydroxyzine  - histamine H1 receptor antagonist but more dirty 
- good against skin allergies, pruritis, urticaria, pruritis, and anti-cholinergic and anti-emetic properties
- AEs: sedating, dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, 
- reducing actiivty in reticular fomation + limbic system 
- helps against anxiety!!!! and GAd. 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">one area - wider use in the context of patietns who have axiety with CNS depressant use disorders such as AUD or OUD where BZs are avoided!!!</mark>

these sedative/hypnotics = are used to relieve anxiety and treat insomnia ; the uses: 
- treating anxiety - feel o apprehension , uncertainty + fear without stimulus apparant
	- anxiolysis - for this treatment 
	- noot typically used for longeterm or chronic anxiety management
		- longterm management arre SSRIs, SNRIs, Buspirone, and 2nd gen antipsychootics 
		- benzodiazepines = used more common for acute anxiety bc might get tolerance and withdrawal 
- sedative - calmness, moderate excitement and decreases motor activity without sleep 
- hypnotic - puts to sleep 
- anticonvulsants
- pre-op sedatives
- muscle relaxation
