2 main classes
compare + contrast benzo + barbiturates
these are like for anxiety too 
benzos - like beta blockers sorta of the psych word
- diazepam, midazolam, alprazolam, lorazepam, flumazenil (antagonist)
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dose response curve of GABA-a is shifted to the left but the maximal effect of gABA doesn't increase.</mark>
- these <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">require pre-synaptic GABA release</mark> for their effects!!!!

barbiturates - mainly past but still tested today 
- phenobarbital, pentobarbital, thiopental ; all -al
- been around for decades. mainly used as anticonvulsants and induction for anesthesia; 
	- anticonvulsants - used prophylactically to prevent seizures like phenobarbital 
	- 
- note - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fatal respiratory depression with OD, induction of drug-drug interactions</mark>, use dependence and withdrawal is life-threatening 
- note - there's a relatively linear relation bt going up on dose + respiratory fatal depression 
- site = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">GABAA ligand gated chloride channel, allosteric site, facilitating more and more Cl- ion channel conductance + inhibition generally, prolonging the opening time of the channel and enhancing the GABA binding + increase potency of the GABA</mark>
	- dose response curve of gaba <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">is shifted to the left!!!! and the maximal effect is up too meaning the s-shaped curve would be moved to the left AND the top will be higher.</mark> and they can also **directly** activate that channel at higher levels. 
- these can enhance GABA conductanc even in the absence of gaba - this is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">responsible for toxicity</mark>


non-benzo benzos? z-compounds
-  zolpidem, eszopiclone
5-HT1a partial agonist
- buspirone
hydroxyzine 

---
these sedative/hypnotics = are used to relieve anxiety and treat insomnia ; the uses: 
- treating anxiety - feel o apprehension , uncertainty + fear without stimulus apparant
	- anxiolysis - for this treatment 
	- noot typically used for longeterm or chronic anxiety management
		- longterm management arre SSRIs, SNRIs, Buspirone, and 2nd gen antipsychootics 
		- benzodiazepines = used more common for acute anxiety bc might get tolerance and withdrawal 
- sedative - calmness, moderate excitement and decreases motor activity without sleep 
- hypnotic - puts to sleep 
- anticonvulsants
- pre-op sedatives
- muscle relaxation
