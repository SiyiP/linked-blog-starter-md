less on boards but more on clinicals 

age related changes
- liver = dec p450 metabolism 
	- more freq used chlordiazepoxide + meperidine are used more 
- dec blood flow to liver by 30-50 % = decreasing clearance of drugs like morphine 
- bring your doses of meds down!!! 
- kidneys
	- dec gfr, dec clearance drugs + prone to dehydration 
		- we see skin tenting / dec skin turgor 
- brain = dementia + depression 
	- more prone to subdural hematomas
	- more likely to get dpression due to isolation 

die from repercussions of dementia , many complicatoins 

more physical injuries
- minor trauma predisposes to significant inuries
- - thin skin, brain atrophy + osteoporosis
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">eccymoses/senile purpura = doesn't take much at all to causes these huge bruises</mark>
	we know it's eccymoses + not contusion bc it's on **extensor** surfaces , **geographic** type **pattern** with variation 
	contusions' more deep and more constant in pattern ... we see huge things
		can be aortic stenosis blood thinners
		heparin
		liver failure too! 
		all these cause coag system fails = blood pooling badly and bleeding
osteoporosis = hip fractures get common + mortality is huge ): 
- prone to pulm emboli + infections 
- comorbidities - will show their teeeth due to hip issue sudden stress. 
brain atrophy - with shrinkign down + pull away 
- subdural hematomas more common - tearig of bridging vessels 

resuscitation changes = consider that recussitation results in visual trauma like ecchymoses from adhesives, chest compressions rib fractures multiple etc. 

nursing homes are ripe for types of abuse 
physical abuse and neglect lead to huge numbers of death  
most casese are not fatal 
1/4 ppl who are victimized 80+ years old 
we're mandated reporters 

---
constillation of symptoms 
- bed/pressure sores
- bruising/fractures
- malnutrition/dehydration 
- freq illness/failure to report 
- poor hygiene
- dirty living quarters
- rapid weight loss/gain 
- unusually heavy meds or sedation 
- sudden mood swings or anxiety 
- low self esteem/depression 
- worrier: 
	- head + neck trauma
	- black eye 
	- trauma to ear is strange = maybe pinced
	- oral trauma / blunt trauma 
	- inner thigh = sexual abuse? 
	- sexual assault = 
		- hematoma displacing the labia, 
		- cystocele = pelvic floor muscles will have uterus + bladder protruding thru the vagina 

typical victims
- 75+ yrs 
- male = female 
- impaired elders
- lives in close proximity with abuser
	- perps are typically relative
	- 2/3 spouse 
	- 1/3 child
	- maybe the perp was once the victim or oterwise
	- stress
	- metnal illness/substance abuse 
- isolation 
	- locks in doors, corner suffering 
	- restraints can sometimes be overused ): they leave it on improperly 
	- chemical restraint with forcing medications 
- hx of domestic violence 

physical neglect 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">decubitus ulcers = pressure ulcers seen in bedbound pts</mark>
	- stge 1 = redness of skin from hours superficially 
	- stage 2 = upper surface of dermis 
	- stage 3 + 4 = takes days and weeks ): fat and bone seen 
	- most likely to exacerbate an decubitus ulcer = diabetes mellitus , nerve and microvascular dmg already making it harder to treat 
	- TREAT: with bandage and make sure you treat it 
	- in  ppl in chairs 
		- on backs of legs, butt, back, and elbows 
- no sheets on bed, feces/urine on there
- multiple ulcers too 
- we need to culture the ulcrs- make sure that the bugs would maybe lead to their death 
- we need protective measures esp if theyre in chairs
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">mimics; contact dermatitis (striaght lines), and TEN, diabetic ulcers (does it line up to how they're laying?)</mark>
- look into helpig ppl out with heat waves and environmental colds and stuff
- soft food diet - sometimes we see food bolus blocking their way that mimics a heart attack. due to weakened muscls
