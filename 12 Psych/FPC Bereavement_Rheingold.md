#psych 

- loss - very braod 
- bereavement - obj situation of having lost someone significant thru death 
- grief - rxn to loss with accompanying cognitive, psych, and physical manifestations
	- universal due to loss of a loved one
	- personal and normal rxn aside from intent to harm 
- mourning - diverse expressions f grief mediated by socio cultural factors 

vulnerable populations - inc risk for Adverse outcomes
- deaths, immune dysfunction, htn, cardiac event, sUD etc etc 
- suicide
- more acute grieving = more frequent seeking of medical care. 

acute grief rxns
- wishing for reunion
- guilt ver not preventing death
- regret 
- sadness/anger
first week - shock, disbelief, poor memory, poor sleep, concentraton 

uncomplicated grief/normal grieving 
- thoughts and memories promnent
- disbelief and depressed and yearning decline 2-24 mon 
- by 6 months -a cceptance of loss inc. 
- STUG rxns
	- sudden temp upsurge of grief- alternating moments of reprieve from grief + acute grief 
	- can happen outta the blue all thruout someone's life 
	- ther's certian grief cues that happen.stug moments get less intense over time. 

grief symptoms = constillation of symptoms
- physical, congitive and spiritual issues all have anger and rapid breathingk , pooor memory, etc. 
- confusion too 

sense of presence - 60% report sensing the dead. 85% feel comforted 

following loss - grief trajectory would have funcitoning which falls quickly and then back up ... 
- in the first month, high levels of functioning ; disbelief , social supports fall away 
- then it decompensates 
- and gets better slowly past 1-2 years 

conceptualizing grief 
kubler ross stages of grief = just be aware 
1. denial 
2. anger- why me 
3. bargaining- yes me... but 
4. depression  yes me. 
5. acceptance it's okay 

no it's not linear 

we move past htis , no empirical support 


dual process model of coping with grief
2 broad stressors in griefing
- loss oriented stressors - loss experience itself, and secondary stressors associated with it 
- restoration oriented - attending to **life changes**
- we need to see confrontation v avoidance of these, which is dynamic 
- we bounce back and forth between the 2 in a dynamic process
- maybe you're loss oriented sometime and then restoration oriented some other times
oscillation is imperative!!!<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">over reliance on any one strat will keep the griever STUCK! you need to tend to the loss and also the restoration</mark>

meaning making model of bereavement
- death of loved one shatters fundamental assumptions of life
- we need to fit this death in the ideas and functionality of our life, our important asusumptions and meaning 

prolonged grief dz
- start to see diff in how ppl grief at <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">6 months</mark>
- resilient are chill 
- common grief go down startng at 6 months 
- chronic grief = prolonged grief disorder PGD or complication grief CG or persistent complex bereavement disorder PCBD 
seen in 8-13% 
- higher rates for sudden/violent causes of death 
- PTSD and maojr depression distnct profile from this 
	- PTSD= truama
	- PGD = separation distress
	- MDD = deficient response-contingent poz reinforcement 
- overall rumination, feeling stuck, hard to accept 

criteria a 
- death at least **12 months ago** of loved one and for adolescents at least 6 mon 
crit b 
- intense yearning/longing and or preocupation with thoughts or memories of deceased 
criteria c = at least 3 
- identity disruption since death
- marked sense of disbelief
- avoidance of reminders that they're dead
- intense emotional pain 
- difficulty reintegrating into relaitonships/activities
- numbness
- feeling life is meaningless
- intense loneliness 
duration + severity exceeds expected social, cultural and religious norms for their individual culture and context all while not having any other symptoms as well 

dilemma - don't wanna pathologize grief rxns but also don't wanna neglect treatment
consider risk factors
- consecutive/truamtic losses
- alc/drug use
- multiple prior losses/maojr stressors
- younger age for women 
- comorbitidides
- lim economic resources
- suddennes + violent nature
- low support network 

dual burden of traumatic bereavement
- survivors of truamatic death - violent or caused by humans = sudden. 
- - both grief/trauma. ods, suicides, vehicle crashes, murders 
- inc risks of pgd, ptsdd, mdd
- pgd = yearning thoughts and memories are there, bittersweet. painful waves of remnders, and typically cognitioons centered on things done or noot done for the dead
- ptsd = intrusive memories, fear, triggers, typically centered on deeds done/not done in relation to the death event 
- mdd = dysphoria/anhedonia, sadness, persistent course, and preocupation with self-critical or pessimism 

early stages of grief can look like clinical depression 
- this often changes past 3 months. 

mental health outcomes upon bereavements might have depression + ptsd 
- a lot of comorbtidy is there

interventions
- supportive therapy 
- early interventions 
- restorative retelling for violent death 
- prolonged expo for ptsd, and cbt
- behavioral activation etc

initiation of assessment = use the loved ones name. 
- what comforts you 
- what concerns u most 
- what else is going on in ur life
- tell me abt the life since death 
- who do you have with whom you can talk ? are they available when u need them 
- what physical sensations do u notice when grief is most intense 

small steps oe at a time
use support network
build bridges
allowing pt to acknowledge meotions, writing juralling 
find ways to celeb good memories 

do - acknowledge loss, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">send condolence letter in 2 wks loss , allow crying, normalize feels, discuss different griefs</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">treat anxiety, depression, insomnia</mark>
- reer to counsoling + support groups

don't wait to have this discussion 
- don't avoid talking abt them 
- don't use i understand, if hat happened to me i would , god has a plan, etc 
- you're not the only one, you should = don't say that 
- don't say deal, move on, or gettng over 
-
