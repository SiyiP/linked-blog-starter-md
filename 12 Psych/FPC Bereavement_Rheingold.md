sense of presence <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">- 60% report sensing the dead. 85% feel comforted </mark>

following loss - grief trajectory would have funcitoning which falls quickly and then back up ... 
- in the first month, high levels of functioning ; disbelief , social supports fall away 
- then it decompensates 
- and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">gets better slowly past 1-2 years </mark>

conceptualizing grief 
kubler ross stages of grief = just be aware 
1. denial 
2. anger- why me 
3. bargaining- yes me... but 
4. depression  yes me. 
5. acceptance it's okay 

no it's not linear 

we move past htis , no empirical support 


dual process model of coping with grief
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">2 broad stressors in griefing</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">loss</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">oriented stressors -</mark> loss experience itself, and secondary stressors associated with it 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">restoration</mark> oriented - attending to<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> **life changes**</mark>
- we need to see confrontation v avoidance of these, which is dynamic 
- we bounce back and forth between the 2 in a dynamic process
- maybe you're loss oriented sometime and then restoration oriented some other times
oscillation is imperative!!!<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">over reliance on any one strat will keep the griever STUCK! you need to tend to the loss and also the restoration</mark>

m<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">eaning making model of bereavement</mark>
- death of loved one shatters fundamental assumptions of life
- we need to<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> fit this death in the ideas and functionality of our lif</mark>e, our important asusumptions and meaning

dilemma - don't wanna pathologize grief rxns but also don't wanna neglect treatment
consider risk factors
- consecutive/truamtic losses
- alc/drug use
- multiple prior losses/maojr stressors
- younger age for women 
- comorbitidides
- lim economic resources
- suddennes + violent nature
- low support network 

dua<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">l burden of traumatic bereavement</mark>
- survivors of truamatic death - violent or caused by humans = sudden. 
- - both grief/trauma. ods, suicides, vehicle crashes, murders 
- inc risks of pgd, ptsdd, mdd
- pgd = yearning thoughts and memories are there, bittersweet. painful waves of remnders, and typically cognitioons centered on things done or noot done for the dead
- ptsd = intrusive memories, fear, triggers, typically centered on deeds done/not done in relation to the death event 
- mdd = dysphoria/anhedonia, sadness, persistent course, and preocupation with self-critical or pessimism 

early stages of grief can look like clinical depression 
- this often changes past 3 months. 

mental health outcomes upon bereavements might have depression + ptsd 
- a lot of comorbtidy is there

interventions
- supportive therapy 
- early interventions 
- restorative retelling for violent death 
- prolonged expo for ptsd, and cbt
- behavioral activation etc

initiation of assessment = use the loved ones name. 
- what comforts you 
- what concerns u most 
- what else is going on in ur life
- tell me abt the life since death 
- who do you have with whom you can talk ? are they available when u need them 
- what physical sensations do u notice when grief is most intense 

small steps oe at a time
