part 1 - AE reactions 

prototypes are covered
main causes of poisoning 
- intentional ods
- unintentional prescritpoion drug od 
- taking meds with same moa 
- recreational od 
- acumulation of drug due to reduced metabolism or clerance
	- disease related 
	- age 
	- d/d interacctions 
	- erros at level of presciribng 
	- occupational epxosure
	- nenvionmental exposure 
main routes
- oral injection
- inhalation like with gases + aerosolized particles 
- contact - pesticides, herbicides 

treat - usually manage resp failure, hypotension, seizures + thermoregulation 

types of AE
- excess pharm actviity = moa based
- SEs 
- d/d interactions
- hypersensitivity = drug interacts with a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">protein to become a hapten</mark>
- genetic variation 
- od 
- environmental toxins 

toxicokinetcics = absorption, distrib, excretion and metabolism of toxins, toxic doses of hterapeutic agents, and metabolites
toxicoodynamics - injurious effecs of these substances on body fucntions 

every drug can be a poison 
- therapeutic index- indication of safety for use of drug - number of animals r ppl responding 
- TI = lethal dose 50 (death of 50% of animals) / ED50 (dose at which 50% respond)
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">larger TI = safr the drug.</mark>

changes in pharmacokinetics ith od
- od may dlay dissolution and then absorption time can be slowed that absorption + peak toxic effects are delayed, where they take too long without thinking 
- drugs can injury <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">epithelial barrier of gi tract , increasing the absorption</mark>
- or first pass can be reduced if capacity of liver is exceeded, delivering moer drug into circulation 
- wiht dramatic inc of concentration in blood, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">protein binding may be exceeded/saturation, rsulting in inc fraction of free drug/greater toxic SE.</mark>

elimination 
- they're usually first order, where rate elim proportional to concentration in plasma
- but if <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">concentration is very high + normal metabolism is satureated, rate elim can be fixed, zero order kinetics</mark>
- this can markedly prolong apparent serum half life + inc toxicity 


managing poisoned patient
ABCDs
- airway 
- breathing - monitor + intubate if necessary 
- circulation
- dextrose - if altered mental state, hypoglycemic patients
med + physical hx = conditions/meds

hx of activities

how to recognize poisoning - view vitals bp pulse, respirations,temp 
- amphetamines, cocaine, antimuscarinics = htn, tachy 
- calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, clonidine, sedatives = hypotension + bradycardia
- hypotension +tachycardia - tca , trazodone, quetiapine, vasodilators, beta agonists
- rapid respirations = salicylates, co, and other toxins that cause <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">metabolic acidosis / celllular asphyxia</mark>
- hypertherma = sympathomimetics, antichoolinergics, salicylates, drugs making seizures/muscular rigidity 
- hypothermia - cns depressants 

eyes
- constriction of pupils - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">opioids, clonidine, cholinesterase inhibitors, sedatives</mark>
- dilation = amphetamines, cocaine, lsd, atropine + ther anticholinergic drugs
- horizontal nystagmus. - phenytoin, alc, barbiturates, other sedatives
- vertical + horizontal nystagmus - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">phencyclidine poisoining</mark>
- ptosis - drooping + opthalmoplegia/paralysis = botulism 

mouth - 
- burns = corrosive substances
- soot = smoke inhalation 
- odors = alc, hydrocarbon solvents, ammonia 
	- almonds + cyanide 

akin + abdomen 
- skin being flushed, hot and dry = antimuscarinics, atropine 
- excssive sweating = organophosphates 
- cyanosis = hypoxemia
- jaundice = hepatic necrosis via acetaminophen
abdomen
- illeus = antimuscarinic, opiooid or sedative
- hyperactive bowel sounds, cramping, diarrhea = organophsophates + arsenic 

NS
- muscular rigiidit = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">antipsychotic agents</mark>
- seizures = antidepressants, cocaine, amphetamines + **diphenhydramine** 
	- causes seizures ; recall dopamine and ach convrge in brain, and ach would ach <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">increases gaba signalling, so if you inhibit ach, gaba inhibited, therefore dopamine getting too much!</mark>
- flaccid coma = sedative/hypnotics or other cns depressants

lab/imging
- arterial blood gases
- electrolytes 
	- hyperkalemia - beta blockers, digitalis glycosides, k-sparing diuretics
	- hypokalemia - barium, beta ags, caffeine, theophylline, thiazide + loop diuretcis
- renal function 
- serum osmolarity 
- chest/abd imging
- tox screens 

decontamination - 
gi tract
- emesis not recommended
- gastric lavage = .9% saline at body temp 
- activated charcoal can absorb many drugs due to large SA 
	- doesn't bind iron, lithium, K+ and alc/cyanide poorly 
	- not useful for corrosives
- cathartics = laxatives + whole bowel irrigation 
- hemodyalsisi - more beneficial esp with electrolyte imbalences
- diuresis - inc blood vol thru oral + IV fluids not recommended bc volume od. 

cmmon antidotes 
- rarer...
- ![[antidotes.png]]acetaminophen - ros in liver + depleting all glutathione storages 
	- - so giving **acetylcysteine** as a glutathione stroage 
	- common od drug - highly toxic in liver 
	- signs = n/v , liver tox / failure 
	- if liver has no glutathione , massive ros in the liver 
- atropine = antimuscarinic!
- fomepizole - to inhibit metabolism 
- flumazenil 
- glucagon 
- naloxone - 
- oxygen 

local anesthetics - LAST = local anesthetic systemic tox 
- some due to accidentaly iv injection 
- mechanisms of tox not completely known 
- inhibition of components of ox phos pahtway 
- mainly impacts heart and brain due to their low use of anaerobic metabolism 
	- in heart = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">now we're inhibiting sodium channels in the heart, some cardiac efffects like conduction disturbance, constractile dysfunction + v-arrhythmias</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">bupivacaine = long lasting + high CV tox</mark>
	- lidocaine - quicker recovery therefore lower toxicty 
- in brain = inhibition of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">potassium channels, causing membrane depolarization + inc neuronal excitability</mark>
	- causing seizures + agistation + dizziness 
	- care via airway + small epinephrine in heart and benzodiazepines for seizures
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">lipid emulsion therapy = to soak up the lipid soluble local anesthetics</mark>



TCAs
- amltriptyline, desipramine, doxepin 
- mst common od drugs
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">competitive antags at muscarinic hcolinergic receptors = tachycardia, dilated pupils, dry mouth</mark>
- some are strong a-adrenergic blockers, causing vasodilation too 
- and quinidine like depressant effects on cardiac sodium channel too = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">slowed conduction, wide qrs, depressed contractility + serious arrythmias</mark>
- TREAT: intubate + ventilate, iv fluids + <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sodium bicarbonate to overcome na channel blockage</mark>

maois/antipsychotics
maois
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hypertensive crisis with tyramine foods... and serotonin syndrome ssris</mark> (agitation, muscle hyperactivity, hyperthermia, tremor, sweating 
- TREAT: - 5-ht antags, propranolol, benzodiazpines)
antipsychotics

- d2 blockers associated w parkinsonian movement disorders, lead pipe rigidity = 
- tREAT: oral dopamine agents like bromocriptine and amantadine 

ethnaol 
- vomiting, difficulty walking, stupor, etc, coma 
- TREAT: supportive care basically sometims iv fluids, helping airway 
- if taken with benzo = usse iv flumazenil 

methanol 
- blindness, death 
- metabolized to formaldehyde + **formic acid** -> metabolic acidoosis 
- TREAT: ethanol to compete + <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fomepizole as adh inhibitor</mark>

aspirin 
- poison with overmed in elderly 
- uncupling of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ox phos + disruption of metabolism</mark>
- hyperventilation, resp alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, delayed absorption, accumulation of lactate + excretion of bicarb by the kidney

fluoroquinolone antibx 
- inhibit DNA <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">topoisomerases</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tendon rupture, irreversible nerve dmg, psych problems, and might cause mt dmg, inc oxidative stress</mark>
- prescrptions inc after antrhax incidents. 
- mt dmg = might be due to gene variant 

beta blockers
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">propanolol most toxic 2-3x normal dose</mark>
- lipophillic = going to the CNS , can have na channel blockng effects
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">bradycardia + hypotension... seizures, cv block, wide qrs</mark>
- TREAT: = give supportive care,
	- note = iv fluids beta agonists and atropine are gnerally inefffecitve to get up bp and heart rate 
	- bta agonists like dobutamine might **not** work 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">but iv glucagon helps = bypass the whole beta receptor, but this directly acts on cardiac cells to raise caMP !!!!</mark>

calcium channel blockers
- poisoning at small ods 
- reduced cv output, bp, depressed sinus node automaticity + slow av node cnduction 
- nifedipine = serious hypotension with od 
- most are slow release = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">good with oral activated charcoal or whole bowel irrigation... calcium, glucagon, insulin glucose are all important</mark>



----
hazard - ability of chem agent to cause injury , subjective, conditions of use + exposure determine this 

risk = expected frequency of undesireable effect from exposure, more data-driven

- bioaccumulation - taking in more toxin than it can rid
- biomagnification - inc in lvls of compounds as it passes up the food chain 

amt exposed to per day or per year that you get no bad effects before u get impacts on ur body 
TLV = threshold lim value = 
PEL - personal exposure limits= 
AEL - assigned exposure limit = 
ratings 1-6 with 6 being super toxic and 1 being practically nontoxic 

industrial settings - inhalationo, transdermal secondary , and oral is minor 
atmospheric pollutants - skin + inhalation 
water + soil - inhalation + ingestion 
duration of exposure = 
- acute = 1 s to 2 days
- chronic - multipel exposures over long time 
know their hx and occupation 
- factory workers - solvents inhalants metals
- firemen - combustion with respiratory issues, higher cancer rates
- agricultural workers - pesticides, herbicides, ozone 
- electrical workers - ozone
- construction/miners, truck drivers - exhaust fumes 
- welder = cadmium 
- dry cleraners = solvents
- painters = solvents/inhalations 

co - binds to hb with much higher affinity than o2 
- harder to compete off. 
- so carboxyhemoglobin can't transport o2. 
- interferes with o2 discoiation from hemoglobin too 
- heart brain kidnesy most seriously affected
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">progressive hypoxia , eventually lose consciousness and die</mark>
- TrEAT: - remove fom exposure, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">high flow + concentration of o2 for a hile , and then hypothermic therapy to reduce metabolic demand of brain... cool body down, and mechanical ventilation is req if resp failure present</mark>

sulfur dioxid - burining coal, smelly 
highest lvsl of is from cities for coal industrial use. 
also from volcanos + hot springs 
- salt lake city too 
- hghly water soluble, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">makes sulfourous acid with moist membranes, will be absorbed into eyes, upper respiratory tract mainly!!!</mark>
	- parasympathetic stimulation: 
	- bronchial contstriction, profuse bronchorrhea, acute asthma, pulm edema with severe exposure
	- children , elderly + asthmatics greatest risk 
- TREAT: - supplemental o2... hard to remove it 

aromatic hydrocarbons 
- benzene - hugely used as solvent + gasoline 
- CNS depressant - euphoria, nausea, vertigo, drowsiness, death 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">chronically will dmg BONE MARROW ; intercallates with dna and causes ros , as a clastogen causing chromosomal breakage = aplastic anema + leukemia</mark>
- no treatment ): 
- this is clastogen 

toluene - methyl benzene
- not a clastogen, but this is a paint thinnr, contact cement, model airplane glu, 
- recreational inhalant - sniffing glue!
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cns depressant, dmg brain cells, skin +eye irritant... not carcinogenic. fetotoxic, delayed ossification of bone</mark>

glyphosate herbicides
- roudup weed killer
- most widely used herbicide in the world 
- GMOs - are reisstant to glyphosate resistant and widely grown 
- they are highly controversial but no evidence for danger
- concern over exposure of this to **bees**
- causes esophagal erosion + higher doses of aspiration pneumonia + renal failure 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">poisonings are common ue to use, eye and skin irritant, cancer of lymphoma, myeloma, leukemia for agricultural workers</mark>

military personnel + burn pits 
- disposal of trash on military bases in ME 
- dumped jet fuel of benzene on them to ignite
- burining puts all these in the air ): 
- they get asthma, copd, cancers, and liver toxicity and many other diseases, like immune disorders. 

forever chemicals  - class of compounds
- pfas = per and polyfluoroalkyl substances
- made to be water, grease and dirt resistant
- nonstick surfaces, in everything we use 
- frozen pizza, nonstick pans , resistant to breakdown in the environment
- used in products + manufacturing - in food, drinking water, etc. 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">colon cancer, immune system disorders, via ox stress +</mark>
