- anterior comminsure - 
- third CN in the midbrain between the 2 cerebral peduncles (interpeduncular fossa)
- 4th CN from the dorsal aspect of brainstem 
- 4th and 6th nerve = single nerve for that musce
- nerve running up the pons = abducens, CN 6 
- one pointing outwars - 7 and 8, 8 is bigger. 
- between olives + pyramid = hypoglossal n 
recall
- Anterior choroidal artery -  branch of the [internal carotid artery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_carotid_artery "Internal carotid artery") which supplies the [choroid plexus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid_plexus "Choroid plexus") of [lateral ventricle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_ventricle "Lateral ventricle") and [third ventricle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_ventricle "Third ventricle")
- The temporal horn of lateral ventricle _extends with the hippocampus laterally_ and contains the choroid plexus.
on coronal sections anterior to the thalamus + hippocampus we can see the optic tract and the amygdala
