mental status exam - higher cog function, orientation, memory lang etc 
note - **many of the organizational materials of brain is only standardized for right handers. if you're leftie it's diffferent
- first question - are you L or R handed?
- and then "have u always been L/R-handed"
- and consider ambidexerous to be L handed too 

mental status exam
- alertness, orientation, -alertness just test by asking ;
	- orientation tho is asking - person place, situation , time = more of a memory test. 
- attention, 
	- serial 7s - basically knowing theyre asking questions appropriately and then test it. basically start at 100 and count back by 7
	- make it easier - spell world backwards
	- months of the year backwards. 
	- lesion to parietal lobe - not able to do math 
		- give them a single problem - what's 100-35?
		- or dyslexic = stay away from spelling backwards 
		- 7 numbers backwards = harder to do it. 
	- attention in general - can't localize it that well. 
	- classic abnormality - **acutely, this is in delirium!!!!! = impairments in attention**
- lang, 
	- fluency, - just by talking. or they could be asked to tell the story, like in cinderella 
		- brocas area- **mediates expressive speech, left posteroinferior frontal lobe right in front of motor area of central sulcus**
		- doesn't flow out , **nonfluent aphasia**
	- comprehension,- are they answering qs and following commands? 
		- **wernickes area - temporal lobe superior posterior on left** 
		- easily flowing out with frontal lobe coming up with them, but no meaning about it at all. 
		- **fluent aphasia - word salad**
	- repetition, - **make sure to do sentences**
	- naming, - this is a waterbottle ? 
	- reading/writing. - 
	-
- memory,
	-  semantic memory - knowing this is a water bottle
	- episodic memory - remembering a breakup 
		- when we test for memory we test for specifically this one
		- word recall - repeat words back to me 5 min later 
		- or visual thing 
		- **classically localizes to medal temporal lobe**
	- procedural - swing a golf club 
	- **classically - alzheimers**
- fund of knowledge
	- assess first and current president - what's ur baseline? 
- other domains - 
- exec function + 
	- planning, sequencing, changing set 
	- drawing a clock and plan where to draw the numbers 
	- fist edge palm, make them do fist, edge of hand and the palm of hand 
	- **prefrontal cortex**
	- - don't have to check for all but sometimes think 
	- connect dots that are from 1-8 and then engage to this 
- visuospatial function 
	- drawing/copying feature. neglect - no longer care or pay attntion to one space, 
	- **parietal lobe, specifically the right one**

L facial weakness - facial nerve 7th ... could be from: 
- infranuclear = esion in L facial nerve itself
- or lesion in the nucleus - nuclear
- supranuclear? 
dec sensation in face = trigeminal nerve 
eye movement - abducens nerve 
8th - hearing 
if they have all the 5,6,7,8 all impactd, they are in the cerebellopontine angle 
- most likely schwannoma of CN 8 getting big and hitting all these nerves 
CN
1. olfacotry - don't test on most ppl unless thy complain
	1. give smell coffe/ pb or something one nostril at a time
	2. smoking causes this, degen parkinsins and alzheimers, and trauma - like disrupting the olfacotry bulb 
2. optic nerve
	1. fundoscopic exam - taking a light in magnifyng glass to look at back of eye
	2. visual acuity - chart and read at back of room 
	3. visual fields - start with both eyes open and if concern check one at a time (have them cover their eye)
		1. point to the finger you see moving, having them stare at your nose, 
		2. simultaneous 
		3. and check each quadrant
		4. visual field deficits are diff based on which lesion it is 
			1. l side of occipital lobe looks at r side of spac.e 
3. pupullary reflex - CN2 and oculomotor, 3 
	1. shine light in their eyes and have them constrict 
	2. effrent - occulomotor 
	3. afferent - CN2 
	4. look at both eyeS!!!!
	5. make sure that both eyes will constrict - **both eyes should constrict when light shined on one eye**
	6. CN 3 lesion - lone pupil doesn't constrict; **unilateral large unreactive pupi - oculomotor palsy**
	7. CN2 lesion. - gonna be sluggishly constricting!! bc this is afferent reemmber - 	pupil responding to lights and sluggishly + shows paradoxical dilation on swinging flashlight test 
	8. horner's syndrome - **unilateral pinpoint/miosis pupil, ptosis too and inability to sweat psilaterally** = injury to the sympathetic nervous system (eye cann't dilate, fight and flight messed up). mainly due to lung tumor or carotid dissecitoon 
4. CN3 - use H not an A with drawing with your finger 
	1. superior rectus, inf rectus, inf obliq, med rectus 
5. Trochlear. -superior oblique
6. abducens - lateral rectus 
7. trigeminal nerve - touch face on lateral forehead, cheek, and next to mouth 
8. fascial nerve - fasical movement + taste on **anterior tongue**
	1. bells palsy - lower motor neuron - whole one face droops
	2. but upper motor neuron issue = **just the lower face drooped/paralysis bc the upper face is innervated bilaterally**
	3. have them smile tight
9. acoustic and vestibular nerve
	1. weber - smile - more midline put it on, bang it and see if they hear it on both sides while u put it on their top of head.
		1. conductive hearing loss = something with their canal, they still hear it thru bone no matter what 
		2. sensorineural hearing loss - can't hear it either way 
	2. rhine test - put it on bone behind their ear
	3. vestibular function - nystagmus 
10. glossopharyngeal  - have them say "ah and watch to see if palate raises"
	1. sensory loop of gag reflex
	2. 
11. vagus
	motor arm of gag reflex
12. accessory n - trapezius + sternocleimastoid - lift their shoulders, look left + right 
13. hypoglossal - stick tongue out and move side to side
	1. test **dysarthria - slurred speech, cause by 5,7,9,10,12**

- 1.5 HEENTÂ 
    - inspect scalp, face, for symmetry 
    - touch on boney sinuses, maxillary ones 
- 9.3 Eyes Physical Examination
    - ask them to look up as you check scleras ask them to look up and down 
    - shine pinlight to eyes , darken room 
    - then after shining a light in 
- 10.3 Ears Physical Examination
    louder in one ear or same in both ears ? 
- 10.5 Nose Physical Examination
    
- 8.3 Head and Neck Physical Examination
    
- 21.4 Cranial Nerves Physical Examination
