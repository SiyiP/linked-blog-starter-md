mental status exam - higher cog function, orientation, memory lang etc 
note - **many of the organizational materials of brain is only standardized for right handers. if you're leftie it's diffferent
- first question - are you L or R handed?
- and then "have u always been L/R-handed"
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">- and consider ambidexerous to be L handed too </mark>

mental status exam
- alertness, orientation, -alertness just test by asking ;
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">orientation tho is asking - person place, situation , time</mark> = more of a memory test. 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">attention</mark>, 
	- serial 7s - basically knowing theyre asking questions appropriately and then test it. basically start at <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">100 and count back by 7</mark>
	- make it easier - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">spell world backwards</mark>
	- months of the year backwards. 
	-<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> lesion to parietal lobe - not able to do math </mark>
		- give them a single problem - what's 100-35?
		- or dyslexic = stay away from spelling backwards 
		- 7 numbers backwards = harder to do it. 
	- attention in general - can't localize it that well. 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	- classic abnormality - **acutely, this is in delirium!!!!! = impairments in attention**</mark>
- lang, 
	- fluency, - just by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">talking</mark>. or they could be asked to tell the story, like in cinderella 
		- brocas area- **mediates expressive speech, left posteroinferior frontal lobe right in front of motor area of central sulcus**
		- doesn't flow out , **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">nonfluent</mark> aphasia**
	- comprehension,- are they answering qs and following commands? 
		- **wernickes area - temporal lobe superior posterior on left** 
		- easily flowing out with frontal lobe coming up with them, but no meaning about it at all. - ccan't understand what they say or comprehend things 
		- **fluent aphasia - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">word salad</mark>**
	- repetition, - **make sure to do sentences**
	- naming, - this is a waterbottle ? 
	- reading/writing. - 
	-
- memory,
	-  s<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">emantic memory - knowing this is a water bottle</mark>
	- episodic memory - r<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">emembering a breakup </mark>
		- when we test for memory we test for specifically this one
		- word recall - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">repeat words back to me 5 min later </mark>
		- or visual thing 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">		- **classically localizes to medial temporal lobe**</mark>
	- procedural - swing a golf club 
	- **classically - alzheimers**
- fund of knowledge
	- assess first and current president - what's ur baseline? 
- other domains - 
- exec function + 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">planning, sequencing, changing set </mark>
	- drawing a<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> clock and plan where to draw the numbers </mark>
	- fist edge palm, make them do fist, edge of hand and the palm of hand 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">**prefrontal cortex** !!!!!</mark>
	- - don't have to check for all but sometimes think 
	- connect dots that are from 1-8 and then engage to this 
- visuospatial function 
	- drawing/copying feature. neglect - no longer care or pay attntion to one space, 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">**parietal lobe, specifically the right one**</mark> = for visuospacial, drawing or copying 
---
L facial weakness - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">facial nerve 7th ... could be from: </mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">infranuclear = lesion in L facial nerve itself</mark>
- or<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> lesion in the nucleus - nuclear</mark>
- supranuclear? 
dec sensation in face = trigeminal nerve 
eye movement - abducens nerve 
8th - hearing 
if they have all the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">5,6,7,8 all impactd, they are in the cerebellopontine angle </mark>
- most likely<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> schwannoma of CN 8 getting big and hitting all these nerves </mark>!!! think of huge tumors if many things are disrupted 
CN
1. olfacotry - don't test on most ppl unless thy complain
	1. give smell coffe/ pb or something one nostril at a time
	2. smoking causes this, degen parkinsins and alzheimers, and trauma - like disrupting the olfacotry bulb 
2. optic nerve
	1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fundoscopic</mark> exam - taking a light in magnifyng glass to look at back of eye
	2. visual <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">acuity - chart and read at back of room </mark>
	3. visual fields - start with both eyes open and if concern check one at a time (have them cover their eye)
		1. point to the finger you see moving, having them stare at your nose, 
		2. simultaneous 
		3. and check each quadrant
		4. visual field deficits are diff based on which lesion it is 
			1.<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> l side of occipital lobe looks at r side of space </mark>
3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pupillary reflex - CN2 and oculomotor, 3 </mark>
	1. shine light in their eyes and have them constrict 
	2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">effrent - occulomotor </mark>
	3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">afferent - CN2 </mark>
	4. look at both eyeS!!!!
	5. make sure that both eyes will constrict - **both eyes should constrict when light shined on one eye**
	6. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CN 3 lesion - lone pupil doesn't constrict; **unilateral large unreactive pupi - oculomotor palsy**</mark>
	7. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CN2 lesion</mark>. - gonna be <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sluggishly</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">constricting</mark>!! bc this is afferent reemmber - 	pupil responding to lights and sluggishly + shows<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> paradoxical dilation on swinging flashlight test </mark>
	8. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">horner's syndrome</mark> - **unilateral pinpoint/miosis pupil, ptosis too and inability to sweat psilaterally** = injury to the<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> sympathetic nervous system (eye cann't dilate, fight and flight messed up)</mark>. mainly due to lu<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ng tumor or carotid dissecitoon </mark>
		1. bsically - there's one tiny pupil and you can't sweat! and your eyelids droop low asf 
4. CN3 - use H not an A with drawing with your finger 
	1. superior rectus, inf rectus, inf obliq, med rectus 
5. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Trochlear n -superior oblique</mark>
6. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">abducens - lateral rectus </mark>
7. trigeminal nerve - touch face on lateral forehead, cheek, and next to mouth 
8. fascial nerve - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fascal movement + taste on **anterior tongue**</mark>
	1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">bells palsy - lower motor neuron - whole one face droops</mark>
	2. but upper motor neuron issue = **just the lower face drooped/paralysis bc the upper face is innervated bilaterally**
	3. have them smile tight
9. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">acoustic and vestibular nerve</mark>
	1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">weber</mark> - more midline put it on, bang it and see if they hear it on both sides while u put it on their top of head.
		1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">conductive hearing loss = something with their canal, they still hear it thru bone no matter what </mark>
		2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sensorineural hearing loss - can't hear it either way </mark>
	2. rhine test - put it on bone behind their ear
	3. vestibular function - nystagmus 
10. g<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">lossopharyngeal  - have them say "ah and watch to see if palate raises" - it needs to rise symmetrically</mark>
	1. sensory loop of gag reflex
11. vagus
	motor arm of gag reflex
12. accessory n - trapezius + sternocleimastoid - lift their shoulders, look left + right 
13. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hypoglossal</mark> - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">stick tongue out and move side to side</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	1. test **dysarthria - slurred speech, cause by 5,7,9,10,12**</mark>
