dental caries = tooth decay 
periodontitis - gum dz 

what physician needs
- medical pen light, tongue blade, gauze - get a 5 min oral exam
extraoral exam - visually observe any asym/swelling, and for lymphadenopathy around the jaw + neck 
eval TMJ for limitd opening, ask them to open wide and feel the condyle moving 
- feel for deviatino, pain popping etc. 30-50 mm normal ROM... 

lip lesions 
- look for SCC and actinic keratosis with sun exposure
- use a tongue blade to retract lips + vestibular tissue
- good thing - with saliva from mandibular glands or buccal with where you swipe for the parotid leakage. 
- getting the left+ r buccla mucosa, lower and upper labial vestibule too 

examine - palate, tonsillar region, and oropharynx 
and then look at tongue - posterior border is huge, and sublingual too . 


prevalent oral dz 
1. dental caries 
	1. most common oral dz
	2. preventable by proper oral hygiene 
	3. microbial etiology - with polymicrobial disruption of homeostasis with the host. 
	4. population of biofilm lays the oundation and some are more prevalent than others 
	5. dental caries / cavities = this is a demineralization process of tooth surfaces
		1. enamel hardest tissue and cementum cis gone - leads to brown or chalky discolorization, tooth sensitivity , pain and spontaneous too. 
		2. oral bacterial metabolism of food **carbohydrates** which result in **acid byproducts that demineralize tooth structure.** 
		3. as the dental caries spread thru enamel, it penetrates dentin layer which has microscopic tubules communicating with the pulp 
		4. dental pulp affected -> hyperemia, necrosis, infection, etc. 
		5. depends on how deep the cavity is, but when it passes thru the enamel dental junction it needs to be treated. when it extends into **dentin we need to treat**
	6. etiology = with **streptococcus mutans and lactobacillius rhamnosus** which is usually less than 1% of total community increase hugely bc of **pH decrease.** cycle of inc acid production 
	7. candy which sticks - carbs that just stick there, which leads to that pH drop eventually . also xerostomia / dry mouth or inadequate fluoride 
	8. tREAT: removal + dental restorations, root canal if invaded pulp and extraction 
	9. be familiar with eruption timeline of kids - some advances in reducing caries in young kids but in 12-19 no improvements 
2. periapical abscesses - localized purulent inflammation in apex of nonvital tooh - 
	1. see **swollen tender gums or some bump**
	2. this is what happens when the pulp gets infected secondary to caries or trauma 
	3. treat: root canal or extraction 
	4. cellulitis - **can happen if abscess isn't able to drain into oral cavity or skin, so it spreads diffusely thru the soft tissue fascial planes**
3. periodontium. - this doesn't impact tooth, but of structures around the tooth:
	1. the gingiva connecting tooth to alveolar bone 
		1. healthy = pink, firm, scallopped gingival cntour, knife-edge gingival margin 
		2. if you do probing depth <4 mm, bleeding on probing happens in less than 10%... bc when u do flossing u do 2-3 mm = excellent hygiene. 
		3. **gingivitis** - super common! inflammation of gingiva, forom bacterial plaque accumulaton and is reversible, no effect on other things 
			1. basically uninterrupted **plaque dev for 21 days!!!** 
			2. we see healthy to unheatlhy: gram + cocci/rods mainly -> rods. + filaments and fusobacterium -> spirochetes and flagellated organisms gingivitis 
			3. red/purple, swollen, bleeding gums, and bad breath aka halitosis + pus. 
			4. smoking and diabetes are huge risk factors. and also plaque, malnutrition or lack of vitamin c, immunosuppression 
			5. TREAT: debridement + calculus accretions ; nonsurgical 
	2. alveolar bone proper
		1. in periodontitis = alveolar bone loss and attachment loss ): so much inflammation that the CT doesn't attach at the gingiva anymore. 
		2. overall huge diversity and huge bacterial mass. 
	3. periodontal ligament - provides support for occlusion and masticcation 
	4. root cemnetum - will be a specialized calcified structure surrounding the root of the tooth 
	5. all this will provide support, proprioception, and vascularization for the tissues 
4. note -**dental plaque = the biofilm on the tooh - colonizing mucosal + dental surfaces**-  this is surface associated and multispecies 
	1. when u clean the teeth, saliva covers it with proteins that will cover it = **acquired pellicle!**
	2. on top of that acquired pellicle the early colonizers come in 
	3. and other late colonizers will **start jumpng and associating with it if the biofilm's not disturbed = this causes disease**
	4. transition bacteria = connects as an adhesion for both early and late colonizers : <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fusobacterium nucleatum</mark>

proposed location of microbial complexes in the periodontal pocket - some most 
- gingivalis, forsynthia, denticola - most associated with severe dz of pockets. 
1. porphyromonas gingivalis - small g-neg black. pigmented anaerobe pathogen 
	1. virulence factors, fimbriae , protease, hemagglutinins aid in adhesion + co-aggregation 
2. treponema denticola - g-neg , obligate anaerobic, **motile**, and highly proteolytic spirochete bacterium 
	1. leucine rich repeated protein adhesins, proteinases, chemotaxis
3. tenneralla forsynthia - g-neg, anaerobic fusiform bacteria 
	1. proteinases 
	2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this is a necessary precursor bc either one of the others isn't detected without this </mark>
- they induce microbe-host interactions with attachment, invade host, and confines of host cells and can invatde the host defenses
- note: they are all found together usually 
- periodontitis - red/purple gums, bleeding gums, halitosis
	- teeth move more than before due to inc root exposure + spaces bt teeth, altered bite/occlusion + pain elicited by chewing 
	- nonsurgical therapy - debridement, calculus accretions, scaling rooot
	- surg = resective surgery, regenerative surg 
	- tooth extraction if all inadequate  + alvolar bone support
1. gingival abscesses - 
	1. abscess confined to the gingiva only like gum stuck into the tissue. 
	2. happens at **healthy periodontal sites**
	3. plaque/foreign material traped in gingival sulcus, so localized swollen/tender gums/suppuration 
	4. we TREAT with curettage/nonsurgical therapy 
2. periodontal abscess- localized purulent inflam of gingiva with involvement of adjacent periodontal attachment + alveolar bone. 
	1. happens at disease sites with loss of attachment or alveolar bone loss 
	2. plaque or foreign material trapped in that pocket caused. 
	3. need surgery or extraction 
3. **peri**coronal abscess - localized purulent inflam of gingiva overlyng a partially erupted tooth 
	1. usually at 3rd molar sites
	2. causes trauma + plauqe/foreign material trapped underneath 
	3. symptomatically smilar to other absess. 
strongest link - T2DM and periodontis 
why does it cause systemic disease? 
- association due to oral bacteria in blood cause infections to distant sites = infectious 
- or bacteria stimulate pro-inflammatory or acute phase proteins distantly = inflammatory 
we also grade and stage the dz
grade = risk factors of getting it in the future 
stage = how severe
