# skull
clinoid process - anterior sphenoid bone surrounding turcica sella
A metopic suture between **frontal bones** normally closes in **1-3 years**, with complete fusion by 4-6 years, but persists in 10% of the population
Anterior to TMJ, the coronoid process is the attachment site of temporalis muscle on mandible.
Bregma: anterior point at junction of frontal and 2 parietal bones

path of internal carotid artery - recall it's like a step on teh stairs!!!
1. thru carotid canal in petrous temp bone
2. anterior thru cavernous sinus 
3. past anterior clinoid process of sphenoid bone 

anterior cranial fossa - cribriform plate the CN 1 
- CN 1 

middle cranial fossa - **thru the sphenoid bone**; lesser wing of sphenoid anteriorly + petrous ridge of temporal bone posteriorly 
- optic canal = CN 2 and opthalmic artery 
- superior orbital fissure; 
	- V1,!!!!
	- also **CN 3 
	- CN 4
	- CN 6
- foramen rotundum = V2 maxillary n 
- foramen ovale = V3 mandibular division 
	- accessory meningeal a from maxillary artery or middle meningeal artery.
	- lesser petrosal nerve on occasion >>? 
- foramen spinosum = middle meningeal a and the meningeal br of V3 
on that sphenoid bone itself....: 
- has a pterygoid process
	- lateral + medial pterygoid plate 
	- at the medial pterygoid plate inside the pterygoid process... **pterygoid canal**

idk?
inferor orbital fissure = A fissure between the greater wing of the sphenoid bone superiorly and the palatine and maxillary bone inferiorly. Contains the zygomatic nerve, infraorbital nerve, infraorbital vein and artery, and inferior ophthalmic vein.
- conveys CN V2 and inferior ophthalmic v

foramen lacerum = 
- greatter petrosal nerve from facial nerve to **pterygopalatine gagnlion to lacrimal glands and other glands**

posterior cranial fossa - thru temporal or occipital bone 
- internal auditory meatus 
	- CN 7 -> enter thru posterior side of petrous portion of temporal bone , thru the ridge and bending posterior+down at geniculum of facial nerve... <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">geniculate ganglion is here. </mark>
		- branches into the greater petrosal N toward end of carotid canal in petrous ridge -> the hiatus and groove 
	- CN 8 - vestibulocochlear N 
- hypoglossal canal = CN 12 
- jugular foramen:
	- glossopharyngeal n IX
	- vagus n X
	- accessory n XI
	- **internal jugular vein** 
- foramen magnum - brainstem + spinal root of 11 

note: the temporal bone has a petrous ridge
- has hiatus + groove for greater petrosal N 
- as well a<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">s hiiatus for lesser petrosal N = this is from CN 9 !!!</mark> going toward foramen ovale 
- also has an arcuate eminence = on anterir side contains the anteriorsemicircular canal 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">roof of tympanic cavity = the tegment tympani</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">petrotympanic fissure = chorda tympani nerve exits thru here!</mark>
	- CN 7 br 

auditory / eustachian tube = connect mid ear / tympanic cavity and the pharynx 
	the opening of it is in the fold under that torus 

pterygoid canal 
- A foramen in the greater wing of the sphenoid bone that transmits th**e artery and nerve of the pterygoid canal** from the **middle cranial fossa to the pterygopalatine fossa.**

recall the sphenoid bone has lesser+greater wing and the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sella turcica + sphenoidal sinus</mark>

viscerocranium = the face of the skull 

pterion fracture = extradural hemorrhage ; fracture involving the **anterior branch of the middle meningeal a**
asterion - where temporal, occipital + parietal bons meet 

Nasion is the depressed point where nasal bones join frontal bone above ridge of nose

mandibular foramen - covered by the end of sphenomandibular ligamet which s attached to lingula 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this is on the inside of the mandible!!!!! a hole seen in it on the side</mark>
---
# cranial contents 
scalp = supraorbital region to superior nuchal lines of occipital and sides to the zygomatic arch 
- due to loose CT in the subaponeurotic space, there's communication of veins facilitating ez infection spread with emmensary vein superficial to deep 

pericranium - periosteum lining outer surface of skull bones 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">3 superficial most layers = move as a unit</mark>, SCA or skin, CT(dense), and Aponeurosis, like when u pull hair or furrow brows. these are things that are taken off when "scalped."

occipitofrontalis 
temporal vr of facial nerve -> frontal belles  
posterior auricular br of facial nerve - occipital bellies
![[cutaneous nn of scalp.png]]- the V1 -> frontal nerve!!!! ->then split to transverse superior orbit 
these are all given by the cervical plexus, note the spinal accessory nerv
- this CN 11 **runs deep to SCM, crossing posterioor triangle**
- superiorly C1-4 = **emerge <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anterior to the middle scalene and not sandwiched</mark>**
- C5 and below = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">emerge bt anterior + middle scalene</mark>
the auriculotemporal n travels with the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">superior temporal artery anterior to the ear</mark>

![[arteries of skull.png]]
occipital a - same region that occipital n is supplying, posterior scalp to midline
- internal carotid a - no branches, goes to the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">brain</mark> but eventually gives <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">rise to opthalamic artery </mark>, which then gives the supratrochlear + supraorbital a 
- - supratrochlear v + supraorbital v -> drain **medial to eye -> then the facial vein and then drains into the internal jugular vein**
- - superficial temporal v from the mid lateral - joins the **maxillary v to to make retromandibular v, making the internal and external jugular vein**
- - posterior auricular v - joins behind the ear directly into the posterior division of retromandibular vein, making that external jugular and internal jugular vein 
- - occipital v - posterior aspect o scalp, but then drains into a plexus that  ultimately would drain into the internal jugular v or vertebral v 
- note about facial veins = no valves = infecton spreads fast in these face 


wider parts of sinus - call lateral venous lacunae on the sides,
- arachnoid villi - will help CSF fluid into the sinuses to offload. 
- inf saggital sinus drains back to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">straight sinus</mark> - in the union of the falx crebri + tentorium cerebelli 
- this takes blood to confluence 
then from the confluence -> **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">drain bilaterally into transverse sinuses and then -> sigmoid sinuses joined by another sinus-> internal jugular vein</mark>**
- ophthalmic veins -> cavernous sinus ->superior and  inferior petrosal sinus joins the sigmoid sinus as it drains into the **internal jugular vein**.
- the superficial temporal vein - joined by maxillary vein making that retromandibular vein! 
	- posterior division of retromandibular v : posterior auricular joining -> **external jugular v
		- note about this <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">if we have heart issues, the external jugular vein dilates, making the CVP measurement</mark>**
	- anterior division of retromandibular vein joins with facial vein, making -> **common facial vein draining into the** -> **internal jugular vein!!!**
![[veins and sinuses of skull.png]]

- superficial cervical nodes. -> skin of neck -> external jugular vein 
- regional nodes submandibular node,s parotid nodes, mastoid nodes + occipital nodes , all drain down to the deep cervical nodes. 

sub+extradural + epidural(bt dura + bones of vertebrae) - these are all pathological 

cranial dura mater  - 2 layered 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">extrnal periosteal layer - lines skull,</mark>, and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">meningeal bvs will pass thru</mark> this layer. 
- 	- periosteal layer of dura - continues with periosteum on other aspect of calvaria at magnum... no traveling down 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">internal</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">meningeal layer - dura of brain makes **reflections** </mark>- fused with periosteal layer. 
	- but eventually reflct away to make the reflections like<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli </mark>
	- **separate hemispheres** 
	- this travels down magnum, -> continuous with SC dura! 

d<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">iaphragma sellae = dural reflection, superior view</mark>
- roof over hypophyseal fossa 

cavernous sinus = **lateral to sphenoid, from *superior orbital* fissure to petrous part of temporal bone**
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CN. 6</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">internal carotid artery!</mark>
- on its lateral wall/the superior orbital fissure: the 3,4, V1, V2 

note - the middle meningeal a is a terminal br of the maxillary artery external carotid artery, which will give all vasc supply too dura 
- this is a br off the maxillary artery!!! 
- hooks into space in cheek = **infratemporal fossa to give rise to the middle meningeal a**
- enters brain via foramen spinosum 
	- divides into anterior + posterior branches and a bunc of others. 

dura innervation? 
CN V1 -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anterior fossa, posterior fossa + falx crebri from ophthalmic division </mark>
	- if this nerve is referred, it refrs to forehead 
	- sensory innervation to the **dura**
CN V2 = middle fossa , maxillary division 
CN V 3 = lateral middle + anterior fossa +middle too  
CN 1-3 = posterior fossa

# neck anatomy I+II
4 longitudinal compartments + 2 triangles with SCM separation 
- hyoid bone - no articulations, floating, ligaments and muscles; many ligaments + muscles
	- where jaw meets the neck 
	- C3 
- inferior to thyroid cartilages is (2 laminae that come together anteriorly at an angle known as the anterior laryngeal prominence, adams apple)
	- this laryngeal prominence of thyroid cartilage runs down midline 
	- C4 = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this is where common carotid artery will bifurcate, and in between is the airway. u need to stick this tube to access that</mark>
- cricoid cartilage = circular , below the laryngeal prom. 
	- retinoid cartilages that attach to vocal folds, **C6**
	-  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">see pharynx ends , esophagus begins, trachea begin. </mark>
	- middle cervical sympathetic ganglion is here, inf thyroid a pass up and over this, mixing with **recurrent laryneal nerve + isthmus of thyroid gland**
		- if cut, vocal dmg
		- isthmus = the butterfly's middle part 
	- below C6, investing fascia surrounds the neck, enclose trapezius + SCM
		- inside the fascia = prevertebral muscles + lateral/scalene muscles + deep back 
		- nerves between anterir + middle scalene = BP 
- tracheal rings = 2-4 of these, isthmus of thyroid glands cover it, T2-3 
![[deep cervical fascia compartments.png]]
vascular compartment = inside is internal carotid, vagus n, internal jugular v 
- the external carotid is not in there, from above C4 bifurcation 
- otherwise common carotid below 
- it is **crossed by omohyoid tendon + then bifurcates as it gooes up**
- external carotid brs coming off below posterior digastric belly , descending into carotid triangle
	- **superior thyroid first br out** -> thyroid gland, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dives down</mark>
	- ascending pharyngeal -> up giving muscles along pharynx
	- lingual -> artery go deep to digastric, supplying oral cavity floor 
	- facial a -> deep to digastric then **wraps around jaw + crosses into facial muscles**
	- occipital a -> behind facial, **ascends deep to posterior digastric, wraps to occipital region**

	- superficial temporal -> terminal br, into the scalp 
	- maxillary artery -> terminal br, infratemporal region , bifurcate same level as the superfiicial temporal
![[arteries of neck.png]]

pretracheal space = continuous into thorax, **to superior mediastinum + anterior mediastinum**
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">having a thyroid enlargement -> confers CV syndromes</mark>
- and vice. versa
retropharyngeal - posterior mediastinum, infections. 
prevertebral= posterior mediastnum , but all the way down to diaphragm , infections 

platysma innervation - cervical br of CN7 
recall dermatomes C2, back of scalp, then middle neck = C3 and at root/base of neck it's C4 

muscular floor posterior triangle 
 - splenius capitis - in the back, behind and up more, deep to the trapezius m 
- levator scapulae - lateral to spenius capitis 
- scalene muscles (3 of them, posterior, middle, and anterior)
- omohyoid from scapular notch with 2 heads and intermediate tendon deep to SCM 
	- makes the subclavian triangle with the SCM and the clavicle . - **if you apply compression you block the subclavian vessels.
	- SCM supplied by CN 11
behind the platysma - motor nerves
- cervical + marginal mandiibular br of 7 
- transverse cervical, great auricular, supraclavicular 

prevertebral m 
- longus capitus - from the occipital bone -> C3-6 transverse processes!!!
	- **this does rotation + flex head + neck**
	- supplied by the ventral primary rami of C3-6 
	- very deep bc of origin 
- longus coli - C5-T3 bodies, insertion into C3-5 transverse processes 
	- medial 

scalenes - rotate + flex neck + ventral primary rami of cervical supply 
- anterior C3-6 trans processes -> 1st rib 
	- C5 and below which make the cervical plexus emerge between anterior + middle scalene 
	- descending on <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anterior scalene muscle = the phrenic nerve, pinned down to here C3-5 via the transverse cervical a and suprascapular artery</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anterior scalene m will separate that subclavian vein (anterior) from the subclavian artery</mark>
		- medial to that anterior scalene muscle - **part 1 of subclavian a = thyrocervical trunk which gives transverse cervical a and supracscapular a**, pinning the phrenic n against that anterior scalene 
- middle = c1-6 trans processes -> 1st rib
	- C1-4 =  come out and simply run down restng on the middle scalene
		- **loop between C1, 2, and C3** = ansa cervicalis , inferior root to C2+3, superior root to C1 
		- note - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hypoglossal CN 12 will hitch a ride with C1, and C1 itself leaves hypoglossal nerve to make the ansa</mark>
			- this loops around the carotid sheath 
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ansa goes on to make nerves to the sternothyroid, sternohyoid, omohyoid </mark>
			- hypoglossal nerve = makes **nerve to the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hyoid genio + thyrohyoid</mark>**
- posterior =  lower cervical vert, trans processes -> 2nd rib 
-
anterior triiangle -
apex = the jugular notch of manubrium
- suprahyoid muscles. = to elevate hyoid bone 
	- mylohyoid ; nerve to mylohyoid is from CNV3 
	- stylohyoid - from styloid process insertion into the greater horn of hyoid + the body , <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pierced by digastric muscle tendon + innervation by nerve to stylohyoid from CN 7</mark>
	- geniohyoid - genial tubercle of anterior inferior mandible 
	- digastric m

- infrahyoid muscles = STRAP muscles <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">supplied by ansa cervicalis</mark>
	- omohyoid m - from superior scapula ; 
		- superior belly -> **intermediate tendon to hyoid bone**
		- inferir belly -> below clavicle to intermideate tendon - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this is lateral and will cross under the SCM</mark> 
	- sternohyoid m - attach to sternum - longest one, in between these 2 the pretracheal fascia is here  
		- **biggest, most medial**
	- sternothyroid m - **under the sternohyoid**, -> oblique line of lamina of thyroid cartilage 
		- makes <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pockets where thyroid gland inserts into</mark>
		- inferior to the thyrohyoid m 
	- thyrohyoid - **under sternohyoid too**
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">innervation by nerve to thyrohyoid - C1 travellling on that CN12</mark>
		- superior to the sternothyroid 
path of the vagus nerve 
- leaves thru jugular foramen to exit out of skull 
- stays n carotid sheath - travelling thru 
	- **give off superior laryngeal n leaving the sheath**
	- this splits into: 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">internal br of superior laryngeal nerve, sensation to larynx down TO vocal folds</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this pierces thyrohyoid membrane!!!! with superior laryngeal artery and vein</mark>
		- external laryngeal nerve - **innervates <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cricothyroid muscle to tense the vocal folds, traveling with the superior thyroid artery</mark>
			- going more down than the internal br 
	- recurrent laryngeal nerve - sensory to all levels below vocal fofolds, loss of voice 
CN9 = glosspharyngeal n = leaves via jugular foramen, bt internal jugular v. + internal carotid cartery 
- 1. deep to the stylohyoid m 
	2. **one thing to recall - sensory brs from carotid sinus + carotid body traveling back to CN9**
CN 11 is bt internal jugular v + int carotid a , leaves jugular foramen, and deep to SCM
CN 12 = leaves thru the hypoglossal canal, which is medial to the internal jugular vein 
	**sweep down and crosses many brs**

having superior thyroid a + v = from the **external carotid to the upper portion of thyroid lateral lobes**
- inferior thyroid a = from the thyrocervical trunk, pt 1 of the subclavian 
	-  cross posterior to carotid sheath 
- superior vein = going nto internal jugular v 
- middle thyroid v =  also going nto internal jugular v ; **there is no artery counterpart- will be on the practical!**
- inferior thyroid veins - drain inferiorly to brachiocephalic veins and might merge into each other. 

parathyroid - never see this, back of trachea, thyroid glands are well-connected, 
- consistent placement - from the 4th brachial pouch embryology - quick lateral trip moves over 
- inferior parathyroid gland - consider it being next to the recurrent laryngeal nerve - from the 3rd pouch with the **thymus**- 
	- not uncommon that it migrates with and sticks to the thymus, going into the mediastinum 

vertebral artery = ascends in 3 parts
 pt 1 , cervical portion - from first part of foramen into the transverse process foramen , entering C6 , 
 pt 2 , vertebral portion - proceeds upwards thru last foramen at C1 in canal 
pt 3, - suboccipital part, swings out and then enters skull in **foramen magnum, and intracranial portion, making basilar artery making circle of willis

# face superficial + facial nerve 

trigeminal nerve - 
V1 = vertex to nose; exit at superior orbital fissure 
- supraorbital n 
- supratrochlear n 
- infratrochlear n 
- external nasal n 
V2 = maxillary - cheekbone to end of top lip 
	infraorbital N , beneath orbit 
	- zygomaticotemporal ?
	- zygomaticofacial ? 
	- exits at **foramen rotundum**
V3. = mandibular 
- auriculotemporal n 
- mental N 
- buccal N , long and cutaneous! 
- **exit foramen ovale**
trigeminal ganglion = in the middle cranial fossa 
- next to the cavernous sinus 
muscles of facial expression = frontalis, orbicularis oculi, zygomaticus major, orbicularis oris , buccinator, platysma 
- palpebral orbitularis oculi - eyelid, closing eyes during sleep 
- orbital oculi- surrounding orbit, closing eye for protection from dust 
- lacrimal - fibers posterior to lacrimal gland bathes the eye  - to control tears and stuff
	- if loss of facial nerve - see tears flowing onto cheek freely, with inability to close eye 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">corneal reflex: a blink loop where both eyes blink and you tear up </mark>
		<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">- 1. sensory component = trigeminal ;  motor component = facial nerve </mark>
- zygomaticus major- retracts upper lip, dilates mouth, bands of muscle from zygo cheekbone to upper lip 
- oris - closes mouth, kissing/whistling 
- buccinator =  keeping food in teeth + mucosa of cheek away from teeth 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">attached to **superior pharyngeal constrictor at pterygomandibular raphe</mark>
![[superior pharyngeal constrictor m at pterygomandibular raphe.png]]
	- pierced by<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> parotid duct </mark>

CN7 
- somatiic motor = facial expression 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">recall it has a general visceral motor function with glands !!!!</mark>
- speical sensory fibers
	- **chordae tympani would b taste in anterior 2/3 of tongue**
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">laterally it comes into stylomastoid foramen</mark>, exiting, and then have the facial canal end there and then it crosses tympanic membrane
		- on medial wall - greater petrosal nerve s a branch of CN7 , enterng thru the internal acoustic meatus and facial canal continues in posterior wall 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">chorda tympani exits at the petrotympanic fissure</mark>
		- will simply pass thru the geniculate ganglion 
		- - from the tongue's 2/3 -> carotid canal -><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> geniculate ganglion </mark>just passing thru -> chorda tympani -> to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">solitary nucleus of the upper medulla! </mark>
- general sensory - around the concha of the auricle + posterior auricular branch - this is around the ear 

intrapetrous path 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CN7 goes thru the internal acoustic meatus **with vestibulocochlear CN8 nerve!!**</mark>
- greater petrosal nerve runs past this 
- will pass laterally + anteriorly into facial canal in petrous part of temporal bone with geniculate ganglion 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">without synapsing onto the ganglion!!!!!</mark>
- anteriorlly and laterally bt cochlea + semicircular canals 
- posteriorly in the facial canal - nerve to stapedius would then exit the stylomastoid foramen 

extracranial path
- after main part of nerve exits the stylomastoid foramen
- straight down gives off stylohoid br 
- and also straight down but more lateral is the digastric br of facial nerve for the posterior belly 
- motor components - 
	- temporal 
	- zygomatic
	- buccal 
	- margin mandibular
	- cervical 

there's 2 parasympathetic CN7 pathways - 
to glands superior to the oral cavity 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">greater petrosal nerve from CN7</mark> -> pass thru the **genicular ganglion, joining with the sympathetic <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">deep petrosal nerve**</mark> which is from Sympathetic plexus on the internal carotid artery.... making*<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> _nerve_ of the pterygoid canal**</mark>, this is synapsing together at the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pterogypalatine ganglion </mark>
	- this hitches ride on V2, maxillary trigeminal to give lacrimal nerve to the gland, and sensory compoennts to nasal + palatine glands inferior to oral cavity 

- CN 7 will innervate **chorda tympani, will synapse on submandibular ganglion** -> innervate sublingual + submandibular glands 

from the major facial artery - 
- supraorbital is lateral, supratrochlear media, and superficial temporal, transverse facal crosses bt zygomatic arch + parotid duct,
- infraorbital as a br f maxillary artery  and mental branch as well 
- the facial artery itself is from the external carotid artery, separation **anterior border of masseter m**


note the parotid has parasympathetic inenrvation via CN 9 !!!!
- glossopharyngeal nerve = the lesser petrosal nerve!!!
- 1. inferior salivatory nucleus -> 
2. CN9 entering thru the jugular foramen 
3. -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tympanic br of CN 9 </mark>
4.  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">preganglionic parasympathetic fibers</mark>
5. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tympanic plexus in</mark> the **middle ear!**
6. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">lesser petrosal N </mark>passes **thru the foramen <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ovale, which is where CNV3 </mark>also travels thru**
7. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">synapses on otic ganglion </mark> in the intratemporal fossa...-> 
8. **hitches a<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> ride on auriculotemporal n from CNV3</mark> to go to parotid gland.**
	1. basically V3 will drop off these parasympathetic nerves off, and then ascend to supply the scalp normally with the superficial temporal artery lol

		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">masseteric</mark> n - massenter muscle !!!
			- note - if there's lesion to this mandibular nerve, we would only be able to contract muscles on unafected side, so there's only the rotation of jaw to the affected side.

			- c<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">horda tympani from CN 7 joinst this V3 lingual n ;</mark> **chorda tympani will pass thru the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">petrotympanic</mark> fossa
		- inferior alveolar nerve ;; 2 has motor and senosry fibers. giving off mylohyoid n, predom sensory and gives off mylohyoid motor nerve too. and sometimes digastric.**
	- runs below the teeth to split into incisive br + mental nerves..... 
- otic ganglion - for parasypathetics, innervate the parotid glands 

temporomandibular joint
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	 - lateral temporomandibular ligament - reinforces the capsle </mark>
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	 - sphenomandibular ligamnet - pierced by myohoid nerve, and then thin br will be preserved. most medial? </mark>
	 - s<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tylomandibular ligament - thin band from styloid process + mandible </mark>

---
# orbital cavity + eye 
roof = frontal bone + lesser sphenoid wing 
lat wall = **zygomatic + greater sphenoid**
medial = frontal process of maxilla, lacrimal, orbital plate of ethmoid 
floor = zygomatic, maxilla + palatine 

superior orbital fissure - CN 3,4,5,6 and opthalmic vein 
foramina = optic canal - optic nerve + opthalamic artery 
lacrimal groove - lac bone over the duct + sac
