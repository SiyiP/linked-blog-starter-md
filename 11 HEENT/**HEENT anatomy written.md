clinoid process - anterior sphenoid bone surrounding turcica sella
A metopic suture between **frontal bones** normally closes in **1-3 years**, with complete fusion by 4-6 years, but persists in 10% of the population
Anterior to TMJ, the coronoid process is the attachment site of temporalis muscle on mandible.
Bregma: anterior point at junction of frontal and 2 parietal bones

path of internal carotid artery - recall it's like a step on teh stairs!!!
1. thru carotid canal in petrous temp bone
2. anterior thru cavernous sinus 
3. past anterior clinoid process of sphenoid bone 

anterior cranial fossa - cribriform plate the CN 1 
- CN 1 

middle cranial fossa - **thru the sphenoid bone**; lesser wing of sphenoid anteriorly + petrous ridge of temporal bone posteriorly 
- optic canal = CN 2 and opthalmic artery 
- superior orbital fissure; 
	- V1,!!!!
	- also **CN 3 
	- CN 4
	- CN 6
- foramen rotundum = V2 maxillary n 
- foramen ovale = V3 mandibular division 
	- accessory meningeal a from maxillary artery or middle meningeal artery.
	- lesser petrosal nerve on occasion >>? 
- foramen spinosum = middle meningeal a and the meningeal br of V3 
on that sphenoid bone itself....: 
- has a pterygoid process
	- lateral + medial pterygoid plate 
	- at the medial pterygoid plate inside the pterygoid process... **pterygoid canal**

idk?
inferor orbital fissure = A fissure between the greater wing of the sphenoid bone superiorly and the palatine and maxillary bone inferiorly. Contains the zygomatic nerve, infraorbital nerve, infraorbital vein and artery, and inferior ophthalmic vein.
- conveys CN V2 and inferior ophthalmic v

foramen lacerum = 
- greatter petrosal nerve from facial nerve to **pterygopalatine gagnlion to lacrimal glands and other glands**

posterior cranial fossa - thru temporal or occipital bone 
- internal auditory meatus 
	- CN 7 -> enter thru posterior side of petrous portion of temporal bone , thru the ridge and bending posterior+down at geniculum of facial nerve... <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">geniculate ganglion is here. </mark>
		- branches into the greater petrosal N toward end of carotid canal in petrous ridge -> the hiatus and groove 
	- CN 8 - vestibulocochlear N 
- hypoglossal canal = CN 12 
- jugular foramen:
	- glossopharyngeal n IX
	- vagus n X
	- accessory n XI
	- **internal jugular vein** 
- foramen magnum - brainstem + spinal root of 11 

note: the temporal bone has a petrous ridge
- has hiatus + groove for greater petrosal N 
- as well a<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">s hiiatus for lesser petrosal N = this is from CN 9 !!!</mark> going toward foramen ovale 
- also has an arcuate eminence = on anterir side contains the anteriorsemicircular canal 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">roof of tympanic cavity = the tegment tympani</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">petrotympanic fissure = chorda tympani nerve exits thru here!</mark>
	- CN 7 br 

auditory / eustachian tube = connect mid ear / tympanic cavity and the pharynx 
	the opening of it is in the fold under that torus 

pterygoid canal 
- A foramen in the greater wing of the sphenoid bone that transmits th**e artery and nerve of the pterygoid canal** from the **middle cranial fossa to the pterygopalatine fossa.**

recall the sphenoid bone has lesser+greater wing and the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sella turcica + sphenoidal sinus</mark>

viscerocranium = the face of the skull 

pterion fracture = extradural hemorrhage ; fracture involving the **anterior branch of the middle meningeal a**
asterion - where temporal, occipital + parietal bons meet 

Nasion is the depressed point where nasal bones join frontal bone above ridge of nose

mandibular foramen - covered by the end of sphenomandibular ligamet which s attached to lingula 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this is on the inside of the mandible!!!!! a hole seen in it on the side</mark>
---
# cranial contents 
scalp = supraorbital region to superior nuchal lines of occipital and sides to the zygomatic arch 
- due to loose CT in the subaponeurotic space, there's communication of veins facilitating ez infection spread with emmensary vein superficial to deep 

pericranium - periosteum lining outer surface of skull bones 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">3 superficial most layers = move as a unit</mark>, SCA or skin, CT(dense), and Aponeurosis, like when u pull hair or furrow brows. these are things that are taken off when "scalped."

occipitofrontalis 
temporal vr of facial nerve -> frontal belles  
posterior auricular br of facial nerve - occipital bellies
![[cutaneous nn of scalp.png]]- the V1 -> frontal nerve!!!! ->then split to transverse superior orbit 
these are all given by the cervical plexus, note the spinal accessory nerv
- this CN 11 **runs deep to SCM, crossing posterioor triangle**
- superiorly C1-4 = **emerge <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anterior to the middle scalene and not sandwiched</mark>**
- C5 and below = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">emerge bt anterior + middle scalene</mark>
the auriculotemporal n travels with the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">superior temporal artery anterior to the ear</mark>

![[arteries of skull.png]]
occipital a - same region that occipital n is supplying, posterior scalp to midline
- internal carotid a - no branches, goes to the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">brain</mark> but eventually gives <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">rise to opthalamic artery </mark>, which then gives the supratrochlear + supraorbital a 
- - supratrochlear v + supraorbital v -> drain **medial to eye -> then the facial vein and then drains into the internal jugular vein**
- - superficial temporal v from the mid lateral - joins the **maxillary v to to make retromandibular v, making the internal and external jugular vein**
- - posterior auricular v - joins behind the ear directly into the posterior division of retromandibular vein, making that external jugular and internal jugular vein 
- - occipital v - posterior aspect o scalp, but then drains into a plexus that  ultimately would drain into the internal jugular v or vertebral v 
- note about facial veins = no valves = infecton spreads fast in these face 


wider parts of sinus - call lateral venous lacunae on the sides,
- arachnoid villi - will help CSF fluid into the sinuses to offload. 
- inf saggital sinus drains back to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">straight sinus</mark> - in the union of the falx crebri + tentorium cerebelli 
- this takes blood to confluence 
then from the confluence -> **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">drain bilaterally into transverse sinuses and then -> sigmoid sinuses joined by another sinus-> internal jugular vein</mark>**
- ophthalmic veins -> cavernous sinus ->superior and  inferior petrosal sinus joins the sigmoid sinus as it drains into the **internal jugular vein**.
- the superficial temporal vein - joined by maxillary vein making that retromandibular vein! 
	- posterior division of retromandibular v : posterior auricular joining -> **external jugular v
		- note about this <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">if we have heart issues, the external jugular vein dilates, making the CVP measurement</mark>**
	- anterior division of retromandibular vein joins with facial vein, making -> **common facial vein draining into the** -> **internal jugular vein!!!**
![[veins and sinuses of skull.png]]

- superficial cervical nodes. -> skin of neck -> external jugular vein 
- regional nodes submandibular node,s parotid nodes, mastoid nodes + occipital nodes , all drain down to the deep cervical nodes. 

sub+extradural + epidural(bt dura + bones of vertebrae) - these are all pathological 

cranial dura mater  - 2 layered 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">extrnal periosteal layer - lines skull,</mark>, and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">meningeal bvs will pass thru</mark> this layer. 
- 	- periosteal layer of dura - continues with periosteum on other aspect of calvaria at magnum... no traveling down 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">internal</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">meningeal layer - dura of brain makes **reflections** </mark>- fused with periosteal layer. 
	- but eventually reflct away to make the reflections like<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli </mark>
	- **separate hemispheres** 
	- this travels down magnum, -> continuous with SC dura! 

d<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">iaphragma sellae = dural reflection, superior view</mark>
- roof over hypophyseal fossa 

cavernous sinus = **lateral to sphenoid, from *superior orbital* fissure to petrous part of temporal bone**
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CN. 6</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">internal carotid artery!</mark>
- on its lateral wall/the superior orbital fissure: the 3,4, V1, V2 

note - the middle meningeal a is a terminal br of the maxillary artery external carotid artery, which will give all vasc supply too dura 
- this is a br off the maxillary artery!!! 
- hooks into space in cheek = **infratemporal fossa to give rise to the middle meningeal a**
- enters brain via foramen spinosum 
	- divides into anterior + posterior branches and a bunc of others. 

dura innervation? 
CN V1 -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anterior fossa, posterior fossa + falx crebri from ophthalmic division </mark>
	- if this nerve is referred, it refrs to forehead 
	- sensory innervation to the **dura**
CN V2 = middle fossa , maxillary division 
CN V 3 = lateral middle + anterior fossa +middle too  
CN 1-3 = posterior fossa

# neck anatomy I+II
4 longitudinal compartments + 2 triangles with SCM separation 
- hyoid bone - no articulations, floating, ligaments and muscles; many ligaments + muscles
	- where jaw meets the neck 
	- C3 
- inferior to thyroid cartilages is (2 laminae that come together anteriorly at an angle known as the anterior laryngeal prominence, adams apple)
	- this laryngeal prominence of thyroid cartilage runs down midline 
	- C4 = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this is where common carotid artery will bifurcate, and in between is the airway. u need to stick this tube to access that</mark>
- cricoid cartilage = circular , below the laryngeal prom. 
	- retinoid cartilages that attach to vocal folds, **C6**
	-  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">see pharynx ends , esophagus begins, trachea begin. </mark>
	- middle cervical sympathetic ganglion is here, inf thyroid a pass up and over this, mixing with **recurrent laryneal nerve + isthmus of thyroid gland**
		- if cut, vocal dmg
		- isthmus = the butterfly's middle part 
	- below C6, investing fascia surrounds the neck, enclose trapezius + SCM
		- inside the fascia = prevertebral muscles + lateral/scalene muscles + deep back 
		- nerves between anterir + middle scalene = BP 
- tracheal rings = 2-4 of these, isthmus of thyroid glands cover it, T2-3 
![[deep cervical fascia compartments.png]]
vascular compartment = inside is internal carotid, vagus n, internal jugular v 
- the external carotid is not in there, from above C4 bifurcation 
- otherwise common carotid below 
- it is **crossed by omohyoid tendon + then bifurcates as it gooes up**
- external carotid brs coming off below posterior digastric belly , descending into carotid triangle
	- **superior thyroid first br out** -> thyroid gland, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dives down</mark>
	- ascending pharyngeal -> up giving muscles along pharynx
	- lingual -> artery go deep to digastric, supplying oral cavity floor 
	- facial a -> deep to digastric then **wraps around jaw + crosses into facial muscles**
	- occipital a -> behind facial, **ascends deep to posterior digastric, wraps to occipital region**

	- superficial temporal -> terminal br, into the scalp 
	- maxillary artery -> terminal br, infratemporal region , bifurcate same level as the superfiicial temporal
![[arteries of neck.png]]

pretracheal space = continuous into thorax, **to superior mediastinum + anterior mediastinum**
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">having a thyroid enlargement -> confers CV syndromes</mark>
- and vice. versa
retropharyngeal - posterior mediastinum, infections. 
prevertebral= posterior mediastnum , but all the way down to diaphragm , infections 

platysma innervation - cervical br of CN7 
recall dermatomes C2, back of scalp, then middle neck = C3 and at root/base of neck it's C4 

muscular floor posterior triangle 
 - splenius capitis - in the back, behind and up more, deep to the trapezius m 
- levator scapulae - lateral to spenius capitis 
- scalene muscles (3 of them, posterior, middle, and anterior)
- omohyoid from scapular notch with 2 heads and intermediate tendon deep to SCM 
	- makes the subclavian triangle with the SCM and the clavicle . - **if you apply compression you block the subclavian vessels.
	- SCM supplied by CN 11
behind the platysma - motor nerves
- cervical + marginal mandiibular br of 7 
- transverse cervical, great auricular, supraclavicular 

prevertebral m 
- longus capitus - from the occipital bone -> C3-6 transverse processes!!!
	- **this does rotation + flex head + neck**
	- supplied by the ventral primary rami of C3-6 
	- very deep bc of origin 
- longus coli - C5-T3 bodies, insertion into C3-5 transverse processes 
	- medial 

scalenes - rotate + flex neck + ventral primary rami of cervical supply 
- anterior C3-6 trans processes -> 1st rib 
	- C5 and below which make the cervical plexus emerge between anterior + middle scalene 
	- descending on <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anterior scalene muscle = the phrenic nerve, pinned down to here C3-5 via the transverse cervical a and suprascapular artery</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anterior scalene m will separate that subclavian vein (anterior) from the subclavian artery</mark>
		- medial to that anterior scalene muscle - **part 1 of subclavian a = thyrocervical trunk which gives transverse cervical a and supracscapular a**, pinning the phrenic n against that anterior scalene 
- middle = c1-6 trans processes -> 1st rib
	- C1-4 =  come out and simply run down restng on the middle scalene
		- **loop between C1, 2, and C3** = ansa cervicalis , inferior root to C2+3, superior root to C1 
		- note - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hypoglossal CN 12 will hitch a ride with C1, and C1 itself leaves hypoglossal nerve to make the ansa</mark>
			- this loops around the carotid sheath 
			- **The superior branch of ansa cervicalis runs with the hypoglossal nerve until the carotid triangle.**
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ansa goes on to make nerves to the sternothyroid, sternohyoid, omohyoid </mark>
			- hypoglossal nerve = makes **nerve to the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hyoid genio + thyrohyoid</mark>**
- posterior =  lower cervical vert, trans processes -> 2nd rib 
-
anterior triiangle -
apex = the jugular notch of manubrium
- suprahyoid muscles. = to elevate hyoid bone 
	- mylohyoid ; nerve to mylohyoid is from CNV3 
	- stylohyoid - from styloid process insertion into the greater horn of hyoid + the body , <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pierced by digastric muscle tendon + innervation by nerve to stylohyoid from CN 7</mark>
	- geniohyoid - genial tubercle of anterior inferior mandible 
	- digastric m 
		- posterior belly from mastoid process , <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">innervation by nerve to stylohyoid CN7</mark>
		- anterior belly from lower mandible -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">innervation by n to mylohyoid CN5</mark>
- infrahyoid muscles = STRAP muscles <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">supplied by ansa cervicalis</mark>
	- **omohyoid** m - from superior scapula ; 
		- superior belly -> **intermediate tendon to hyoid bone**
		- inferir belly -> below clavicle to intermideate tendon - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this is lateral and will cross under the SCM</mark> 
	- sternohyoid m - attach to sternum - longest one, in between these 2 the pretracheal fascia is here  
		- **biggest, most medial**
	- sternothyroid m - **under the sternohyoid**, -> oblique line of lamina of thyroid cartilage 
		- makes <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pockets where thyroid gland inserts into</mark>
		- inferior to the thyrohyoid m 
	- thyrohyoid - **under sternohyoid too**
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">innervation by nerve to thyrohyoid - C1 travellling on that CN12</mark>
		- superior to the sternothyroid 
path of the vagus nerve 
- leaves thru jugular foramen to exit out of skull 
- stays n carotid sheath - travelling thru 
	- **give off superior laryngeal n leaving the sheath**
	- this splits into: 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">internal br of superior laryngeal nerve, sensation to larynx down TO vocal folds</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this pierces thyrohyoid membrane!!!! with superior laryngeal artery and vein</mark>
		- external laryngeal nerve - **innervates <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cricothyroid muscle to tense the vocal folds, traveling with the superior thyroid artery</mark>
			- going more down than the internal br 
			- superior thyroid a - br off the external carotid a 
	- recurrent laryngeal nerve - sensory to all levels below vocal fofolds, loss of voice 
		- The recurrent laryngeal nerve changes its name to the inferior laryngeal nerve at the level of the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage. The inferior laryngeal nerve goes on to innervate all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx except cricothyroideus. So, if this nerve innervating all the muscles of the larynx was damaged, a patient would have a hoarse voice.
CN9 = glosspharyngeal n = leaves via jugular foramen, bt internal jugular v. + internal carotid cartery 
- 1. deep to the stylohyoid m 
	2. **one thing to recall - sensory brs from carotid sinus + carotid body traveling back to CN9**
CN 11 is bt internal jugular v + int carotid a , leaves jugular foramen, and deep to SCM
CN 12 = leaves thru the hypoglossal canal, which is medial to the internal jugular vein 
	**sweep down and crosses many brs**

having superior thyroid a + v = from the **external carotid to the upper portion of thyroid lateral lobes**
- inferior thyroid a = from the thyrocervical trunk, pt 1 of the subclavian 
	-  cross posterior to carotid sheath 
	- The inferior thyroid arteries are closely associated with the middle cervical sympathetic ganglia and supply the inferior poles of the thyroid. they are the primary source of blood for the four parathyroid glands.
- superior vein = going nto internal jugular v 
- middle thyroid v =  also going nto internal jugular v ; **there is no artery counterpart- will be on the practical!**
- inferior thyroid veins - drain inferiorly to brachiocephalic veins and might merge into each other. 

parathyroid - never see this, back of trachea, thyroid glands are well-connected, 
- consistent placement - from the 4th brachial pouch embryology - quick lateral trip moves over 
- inferior parathyroid gland - consider it being next to the recurrent laryngeal nerve - from the 3rd pouch with the **thymus**- 
	- not uncommon that it migrates with and sticks to the thymus, going into the mediastinum 
	- **The left and right recurrent laryngeal nerves can be found in the left and right tracheoesophageal grooves.**

vertebral artery = ascends in 3 parts
 pt 1 , cervical portion - from first part of foramen into the transverse process foramen , entering C6 , 
 pt 2 , vertebral portion - proceeds upwards thru last foramen at C1 in canal 
pt 3, - suboccipital part, swings out and then enters skull in **foramen magnum, and intracranial portion, making basilar artery making circle of willis

# face superficial + facial nerve 

trigeminal nerve - 
V1 = vertex to nose; exit at superior orbital fissure

- buccal N , long and cutaneous! 
- **exit foramen ovale**
trigeminal ganglion = in the middle cranial fossa 
- next to the cavernous sinus 
muscles of facial expression = frontalis, orbicularis oculi, zygomaticus major, orbicularis oris , buccinator, platysma 
- palpebral orbitularis oculi - eyelid, closing eyes during sleep 
- orbital oculi- surrounding orbit, closing eye for protection from dust 
- lacrimal - fibers posterior to lacrimal gland bathes the eye  - to control tears and stuff
	- if loss of facial nerve - see tears flowing onto cheek freely, with inability to close eye 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">corneal reflex: a blink loop where both eyes blink and you tear up </mark>
		<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">- 1. sensory component = trigeminal ;  motor component = facial nerve </mark>
- zygomaticus major- retracts upper lip, dilates mouth, bands of muscle from zygo cheekbone to upper lip 
- oris - closes mouth, kissing/whistling 
- buccinator =  keeping food in teeth + mucosa of cheek away from teeth 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">attached to **superior pharyngeal constrictor at pterygomandibular raphe</mark>
![[superior pharyngeal constrictor m at pterygomandibular raphe.png]]

CN7 
- somatiic motor = facial expression 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">recall it has a general visceral motor function with glands !!!!</mark>
- speical sensory fibers
	- **chordae tympani would b taste in anterior 2/3 of tongue**
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">laterally it comes into stylomastoid foramen</mark>, exiting, and then have the facial canal end there and then it crosses tympanic membrane
		- on medial wall - greater petrosal nerve s a branch of CN7 , enterng thru the internal acoustic meatus and facial canal continues in posterior wall 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">chorda tympani exits at the petrotympanic fissure</mark>
		- will simply pass thru the geniculate ganglion

- general sensory - around the concha of the auricle + posterior auricular branch - this is around the ear 

intrapetrous path 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CN7 goes thru the internal acoustic meatus **with vestibulocochlear CN8 nerve!!**</mark>
- greater petrosal nerve runs past this 
- will pass laterally + anteriorly into facial canal in petrous part of temporal bone with geniculate ganglion 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">without synapsing onto the ganglion!!!!!</mark>
- anteriorlly and laterally bt cochlea + semicircular canals 
- posteriorly in the facial canal - nerve to stapedius would then exit the stylomastoid foramen 

extracranial path
- after main part of nerve exits the stylomastoid foramen
- straight down gives off stylohoid br 
- and also straight down but more lateral is the digastric br of facial nerve for the posterior belly 
- motor components - 
	- temporal 
	- zygomatic
	- buccal 
	- margin mandibular
	- cervical 

there's 2 parasympathetic CN7 pathways - 
to glands superior to the oral cavity 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">greater petrosal nerve from CN7</mark> -> pass thru the **genicular ganglion, joining with the sympathetic <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">deep petrosal nerve**</mark> which is from Sympathetic plexus on the internal carotid artery.... making*<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> _nerve_ of the pterygoid canal**</mark>, this is synapsing together at the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pterogypalatine ganglion </mark>
	- this hitches ride on V2, maxillary trigeminal to give lacrimal nerve to the gland, and sensory compoennts to nasal + palatine glands inferior to oral cavity 

- CN 7 will innervate **chorda tympani, will synapse on submandibular ganglion** -> innervate sublingual + submandibular glands 

from the major facial artery - 
- supraorbital is lateral, supratrochlear media, and superficial temporal, transverse facal crosses bt zygomatic arch + parotid duct,
- infraorbital as a br f maxillary artery  and mental branch as well 
- the facial artery itself is from the external carotid artery, separation **anterior border of masseter m**


note the parotid has parasympathetic inenrvation via CN 9 !!!!
- glossopharyngeal nerve = the lesser petrosal nerve!!!
- 1. inferior salivatory nucleus -> 
2. CN9 entering thru the jugular foramen 
3. -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tympanic br of CN 9 </mark>
4.  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">preganglionic parasympathetic fibers</mark>
5. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tympanic plexus in</mark> the **middle ear!**
6. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">lesser petrosal N </mark>passes **thru the foramen <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ovale, which is where CNV3 </mark>also travels thru**
7. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">synapses on otic ganglion </mark> in the intratemporal fossa...-> 
8. **hitches a<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> ride on auriculotemporal n from CNV3</mark> to go to parotid gland.**
	1. basically V3 will drop off these parasympathetic nerves off, and then ascend to supply the scalp normally with the superficial temporal artery lol

# orbital cavity + eye 
roof = frontal bone + lesser sphenoid wing 
lat wall = **zygomatic + greater sphenoid**
medial = frontal process of maxilla, lacrimal, orbital plate of ethmoid 
floor = zygomatic, maxilla + palatine 

superior orbital fissure - CN 3,4,5,6 and opthalmic vein 
foramina = optic canal - optic nerve + opthalamic artery 

- periorbita - the fascia - dense CT layer, **continuous with the periosteum lining the skull/endosteal layer of dura mater**
choroid - most posterior, middle vascularized layer bt the retina + sclera 
ciliary body- connect choroid to iris - controls the lens shape thru zoneular fibers which make the suspensory ligament move 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">contraction of ciliary bod = decreasing diameter + releases sus lig tension, making it rounder + inc light refraction</mark>

		- lets more light in like when you're running in forest in dark. 
most internal layer - retina = neuronal layers and stuff
- anterior margin = **ora serrata** =  serrated junction between the choroid and the ciliary body
- optic disc - depression insensitive to light, connection of the optic nerve
- macula lutea - small oval area lateral to optic disc - center is the fovea centralis - area of most **acute** vision -<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> light detecting cells like cones are there </mark>


bulbar conjunctiva = thin moist transparent membrane covering it will reflect off the **posterior surface of eyelids = palpebral conjunctiva**
- makes the sup+inf fornices on the posterior + anterior eye 
- opens in palpebral fissue = the space bt the open eyelids + eye 


- aqueous humor - in lens clear in **anterior + posterior chambers, nutrients to avascular lens + cornea**
vs 
- vitreous body - jelly , 99% water, transmits ligth + holds retina + lens in place, transmission of light into retina 

eyelids - - strengthed by the **tarsal plate up top, , which has glands that secrete oily substance, tarsal glands**
- orbicularis oculi will help reinforce this strength 
the lateral + medial **canthis - dots of eye are!!!**
orbital septum - anchors these tarsal plates to the oculi 

lacrimal: 
![[lacrimal apparatus.png]]
lacrimal gland itself - is on the top and lateral side having an orbital part and a palpebral part closer to the eyelid with tears emptying here going to the midline 
1. medial = lacrimal lake - lacus lacrimalis looks like our tear bed 
2. lacrimal caruncle - that bulge or circle in our tear bed center 
3. semilunar fold/plica semilunaris - fold of conjunctiva in this region 
4. lacrimal papillae - in the upper and lower eyelid immediately above + below the tear beds !!! 
5. lacrimal punctum - the holes in the middle of the lacrimal papillae! **for tear draining**
	1. they drain via lacrimal canaliculi into the lacrimal sac
	2. this sac will be drained by the nasolacrimal duct into the nasal cavity!!! via<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> inferior nasal meatus </mark>

# oral 
- floor - muscular diaphragm (mylohyoid + geniohyoid(deeper))
- oral vestibule - anterior surface of teeth to inner lip - where you pack dip into 
parotid gland - empties into the **oral vestibule at area of the level 2nd maxillary molar thru parotid duct**

oral cavity proper - inner surface of anterior teeth to the **oropharyngeal isthmus(posteriormost opening into the oropharynx)**
- bound by superior palates, floor of mout underneath, inner surfaces of teeth anteriorly 
- made by: 
	- palatoglossal folds antero and lateral 
	- soft palate 
	- terminal sulcus of tongue which will divide posterior 1/3 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">along the terminal sulcus - the remnant of thyroglossal duct </mark>= **foramen cecum**
	- food/liquid is held in the oral cavity while breathing when the isthmus is closed. 
incisive foramen - **nasopalatine** nerve supplies the anterior hard palate mucosa!!! accompanied by **sphenopalatine vessels!**

greater palatine vessels and lesser palatine vessels will exit thru their respective foramina 

mandible 
- superior + inferior mental spine = the genial tubercles -  on the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inside of the mandible (lower jawbone) that serve as attachment points for the genioglossus and geniohyoid muscles</mark>
	- geniohyoid - attach to the inferior mental spine of mandible to hyoid.. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">innervation via hypoglossal n, ventral ramus of C1....</mark>
- sublingual fossa - where sublingual gland is  
- mandibular foramen = **the inferior alveolar nerve goes thru here, CN V3**
	passes thru the mandibular canal -> and then give brs to teeth 
	- basically all blood supply of the teeth is from the maxillary artery btw!!! with external carotid artery; there's posterior alveolar a => supplies the premolars and the molar teeth . 
	- note - the inf alveolar artery + vein  passes thru the mandibular canal, accompanying the inferior alveolar nerve 
- branch of the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">**infaorbital artery in the pteropalatine fossa -> anterior** superior alveolar a + v </mark>- supplies canines + incisors 

- in adult - teeth erupts around age 6, with the 3rd molar not there til age 17-30 
- 30 deciduous teeth = **baby teeth, come before**
	- 6 mon - 2 yrs of age 
	- no premolars and no 3rd molar yet for kids 

innervation of teeth = all CN V
maxillary teeth - anterior superior alveolar nerve + middle superior alveolar n 
	brs of infraorbital nerve of V2 , supplying **canines + premolars!**
- posterior superior alveolar nerve = will be directly off maxillary nerve V2, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">and be4 t gets to teeth, posterioor superior alveolar nerve innervates maxillary sinus mucosa!</mark>
- mandibular teeth - from inferior alveolar nerve V3 like the one who ges thru the foramen 

roof of oral cavity - hard cavity = the maxilla 
- lining: palatine rugae. 
- palatine raphe - why we have a fusion of palatine cells = the median longitudinal line
- has the incisive papillae on top of the incisive foramen. 

palatal blood'- external carotid a 
- ascending pharyngeal artery from external carotid
- facial artery from the ascending palatine a 
- **maxillary artery -> INSIDE THE pterygopalatine fossa...**
	- -> DESCENDING PALATINE ARTERY 
	- greater palatine a -> hard 
	- lesser palatine a -> soft palate 

the 3 branches of V2 - wll be providing to the hard palate thru the greater palatine nerve or lesser?
- the greater + lesser palaitine nervs would extend down from the inferior aspct of the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pteropalatine ganglion</mark>
	- greater palatine nerve V2 - descends thru the _pterygopalatine_ fossa + palatine canal 
	- nasopalatine n V2 = from the pterygopalatine fossa, travels thru nasal and descends thru incisive canal 
- general sensory of soft palate -
	- lesser palatine n v2 go thru lesser palatine foramen into soft palate 

median raphe  - combines mylohyoids in the middle 
- to elevate hyoid bone, base of tongue, floor of mouth 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inferior alveolar nerve -> </mark>nerve to mylohyoid - **before!!! the inferior alveolar nerve enters the mandibular foramen**

deep to the geniohyoid, 
tongue intrinsic muscles - innervated by hypoglossal n 
extrinsic muscles.... 
- genioglossus - CN12 too, protrude, retract, depress + elevate tongue 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fan shaped </mark>attaching into the **superior mental spine of mandible, blending posteriorly with the other tonogue fibers**
	- can stick out tongue, if injured this will go off midline 
- hyoglossus - CN 12 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">covers the genioglossus m laterally?</mark>
	- rectangle , depress + retract tongue 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">deep to this muscle, the lingual artery would enter the tongue!</mark> 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">on the EXTERNAL SURFACE of this, you will find the CN12 and lingual nerve br of CN V3 enter the tongue!!!!!!</mark>
- styloglossus = CN 12 
	- blends into lateral aspect of the tongue - the arc that connects the lateral tongue to the styloid way up, 
	- draws it up to **swallow**
- palatoglossus = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CN 10!!!</mark>
	- this is from soft palate inserting laterally into the tongue! 
	- this is right under th palatoglossal folds antero and lateral 
	- **from palatine aponeuosis / soft palate** - basically layer of soft palate blending laterally 
	- lateral boundaries of the oropharyngeal isthmus

tongue papillae: 
- folliate papillae = no taste buds !! most numerous and have nerv endings, on the lateral aspect of tongue 
- fungiform  papillae - rounder, 
- vallate papillae - fewest but largest - in shape of terminal sulcus 
main blood supply is the lingual artery which is br of ext. carotid artery 
- this will travel bt hyoglossus + genioglossus muscles to apex of tongue 

general sensory f tongue
- lingual n - V3 anterior 2/3 , where it comes out of the ovale -> lingual n -> infratemporal fossa -> both motor and sensory information 
- posterior 1/3 = **glossopharyngeal n CN 9; help with taste too**
special taste sensation: 
- on the anterior 2/3 the chorda tympani br of CN 7 will join the V3 lingual nerve br to give taste. 
- posterior is glossopharyngeal like i said be4 

- sublingual gland
	- smallest, in the sublingual fossa against medial surface of mandible 
	- superior to the mylohyoid **+ lateral to the submandibular duct** 
	- drains into the oral cavity via ducts opening into **crest of the sublingual fold** 
submandibular gland - hook shaped 
	- superficial part = outside of oral cavity, bt myohyoid muscle + mandible 
	- deep = hoook around mylohyoid muscle, lateral to tongue roof 
	- the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">submandibular duct comes from the medial part of this deep part and passes over lingual nerve... the lingual nerve would loop under the submandibular duct.... passing thru the sublingual caruncle opening of the oral cavity floor</mark>
parasympathetic salivary gland innervation 
sublingual + submandibular get signals from CN7, br of chorda tympani which <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">joins the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the lingual V3</mark>
- this goes into the oral cavity 
- gangion in the oral cavity = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">submandibular ganglion, which will send postganglionic parasympathetics to the glands</mark>
we drain from the tip tongue to **submental nodes**, other wise, everything to the submandibular nodes. 
palate drain to deep cervical directly

# pharynx + palate 

pharynx - opening anteriorly to nasal cavities, mouth, and larynx, the choanae of the nostrils 
- extending to C6 where esophagus begins ; air going to lungs and food to the stomach 
- opening to nasopharynx - choanae ; most superior portion of the nasopharynx = hypophyseal fossa
	- roof = body of sphenoid + basilar occipital bone 
	- floor = soft palate
	- posterior = **superior pharyngeal constrictor muscles**
along this lateral wall - 
- under the auditory tube, there's cartilage 
- 2 muscles deep to the soft palate = the tensor + levator veli palatini muscles. 
	- levator - seals that nasal pharynx, preventing food regurgitation 	- tensor veli palatini - on that back wall , 
	- torus tubarius - tubal elevation , **near the auditory tube in the posterior aspect**
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">salpingopharyngeal fold is under it , inferior aspect, covering that salpingopharyngius muscle</mark>
		- posterior to this is the pharyngeal recess....? 
	- uvulus muscle - muscularus uvulae deepest layer 

pharyngeal isthmus - where nasopharynx is continuous w/ oropharynx - **marked by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fold from palatopharyngeal sphincter, which is an inferior part of the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle</mark>**
- nasopharynx V2 innervation for sensory 

oropharynx extends down to epiglottis ; CN 9 via pharyngeal plexus sensory 
- roof = soft palate + pharyngeal isthmus 
- floor = posterior 1/3 of tongue + valleculae, pharyngeal tongue etc. 
- valleculae - pair of mucosal pouches - **bt base of tongue + epiglottis**
- glossoepiglottic folds binding this place laterally and one medially tooo, dividing that space into 2
palatine tonsils seen bt palatoglossal + palatopharyngeal folds 
the oropharyngeal isthmus is bound laterally by palatoglossal arches... then the palatopharyngeal arch is posterior + medial to the folds. 
to close the isthmus: 
- palatoglossal arches - **contract down** and medial 
	- folds, arches are the palatoglossus muscle covered with mucosa layer forming boundary of isthmus around lateral wall 
- palatopharyngeal arches - **contract down** and medial 
	- palatopharyngeal folds cover the palatopharyngeaus. , posterior + medial to those palatoglossal folds
	- this is a **landmark for palatine tonsils** ; in the tonsillar sinus, very vascularized area between the folds!  
- posterior tongue up 
- soft palate down + forwards 



laryngopharynx - posterior to laryngeal inlet ->C6 the esophagus - ;; CN 10! specifically the **internal laryngeal nerve, a branch of the superior laryngeal nerve!!!- from superior border of epiglottic cartilage to inf border of cricoid cartilage 
- down the anterior wall = laryngeal inlet + posterior aspect of larynx 
- pharyngeal constrictor muscles AND bodies of 3-5th cervical vertebrae  = make up posterior wall 
- laterally buond by the thyroid cartilage 
- piriform recesses = lateral to the laryngeal inlet ; - directs solids/iquids from oral cavity **around** **raised** laryngeal inlet and into esophagus , preventing that larynx food entry... <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">common site of foreign body lodging, feel like smths in throat, repeated gagging etc.</mark>
- deep to piriform recess = entrance of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">internal laryngeal nerve as it pierces thryoid membrane!!! internal br of the superior laryngeal nerve. eventually passes thru that thyrohyoid membrane to reach larynx to supply to mucosa above vocal folds</mark>

3 circular layers of the pharynx = all CN X 
- superior pharyngeal constrictor , to the pharyngeal raphe !!! median point posteriorly **joins all the pharyngela constrictors**
	- constrict pharynx during swallowing+ seals off that yu're not regurgitating food into that nasal cavity 
- middle pharyngeal constrictor -  from stylohyoid lig , horning at hyoid -> pharyngeal raphe, CN x
- inferior pharyngeal constrictor - oblique line of thyroid cartilage/cricoid-cartilage -> pharyngeal raphe (this is on the postrerior side, this extends all the way from base of skull -> C6) 
	- cricopharyngeus muscle, the most inferior fibers of the inf pharyngeal constrictor muscle 
	- **sphincter at lowest end of pharynx to prevent entry of air into esophagus when swallowing food**
lnogitudinal muscles 
- salpingopharyngeus m - from auditory tube -> lateral pharyngeal wall, helps raise pharynx + larynx whle swallowing + speaking 
	<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	- can open the pharyngeal opening of the auditory tube to equalize pressure bt middl ear + pharynx in swallowing </mark>
- palatopharyngeus m - palatine aponeurosis -> lateral pharyngeal wall 
	- tenses soft palate, elevating pharynx + closes oropharyngeal isthmus 
- stylopharyngeus m - from styloid process of temporal, best from the posterior view-> pharyngeal wall, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">posterior of thyroid caritlage </mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the only one that's CN 9, glossopharyngeal n underneath tis</mark>

- all vessels of upper pharyngeal wall = **external carotid a origins**
	- ascending pharyngeal a 
	- br of facial artery: asceeding palatine, tonsillar a 
	- br of maxillary + lingual arteries
	- lower pharynx - pharyngeal brs of inf thyroid a , **which is from that thyrocervical trunk, which is part of the subclavian a**

- recall - the pteropalatine ganglion having that greater petrosal nerve going into it into the pteropalatine fossa 
- - branches coming from the ganglion inferiorly - > 
	- greater palatine nerve V2 -> general sensory into the gums via the palatine canal then the greater palatine foramen , to the hard palate 
	- nasopalatine nerve V2 -> going thru the incisive canal into the nasal septum to give that mucosa of hard palate information 
	- lesser palatine nerve, V2 also going thru the palatine canal and lesser palatine foramen = also the general sensory but for the soft palate

# larynx 
- closes valve of lower resp tract during swallowing to maintain patent airway 
- open valve during respiration 
-  palpated inf to hyoid + deep to infrahyoid mm , deep to thyroid gland lateral lobes 
- laryngeal prominence protrudes bt infrahyoid mm 
	- C4 = superior margin f thyroid cartilage and bifurcation of common carotid artery 
	- C6 =  cricoid cartilage, larynx continuous with trachea , and beginning of esophagus  
inlet = comm bt laryngeopharynx + larynx .... 
anterior = epiglottis 
lat = aryepiglottic folds, 
posterior/inf = **interarytenoid** fold 

cricoid cartilage =  = most inferior, surrounding the trachea, looking like a signet ring
- posterior portion has lamina, front piece thinner with 4 articular faces: 
- 2 superior posterior artenoid cartilages
	- these artenoid cartilages are paired, base + apex.... 
	- base of this cartilage sits posteriorly + articulates with cricoid catilage 
	- apex = projecting superiorly and articulation with corniculate cartilages 
	- muscular process laterally project to **site of attachment for cricoarytenoid muscles**
	- vocal process. - projects anteriorly vocal ligament attaches here. 
-  2 on the posterior inferior, articulating w the thyroid cartilage or inferior horn 

horns of the thyroid is on the back, posterior. 
- superior horn extends into the **lateral thyrohyoid ligaments**, and both inferior horns have a facet with the cricoid to make cricothyroid joint 
- oblique line bt the inf horn and the anterior = tis is site of attachment for 2 infrahyoid + inf pharyngeal constrictor mm 

the epiglottis - 			- attaches via hypoepiglottic ligament to hyoid bone


 3 smaller cartilages = help vocal ligaments move and make diff sounds 
		- arytenoid; 	- quadrangular membrane will connect the epiglottis to arytenoid 
		- corniculate
		- cuneform 
- - quadrangular membrane - wraps around the side of airway, along edge of epiglottis, lower edge = vestibular lig 
- - conus elasticus - extending up from the cricoid cartilage wrapping up around the airway -> free margin to make the **vocal ligament!! on the upper edge!**
