pair this with taste when doing this. 

- think about the neuron population coming into contact with the environment
- - basically cribriform plate holes let it reach olfaction bulb 
- only one that doens't need to synapse on the thalamus somewhere. 

olfactory epithelium - on roof of nasal mucosa - only volatile chemicals can reach it 
- do some strong inhalations to bind to the receptors 
- our bulbs are small. 
- olfactory nerve is small compared to other species. 

olfactory mucosa - 
- olfactory receptor cells - are bipolar, 
- dendritic ends is with the apical ends, **bulb with cilia extending out into the mucos on the outside**
- cilia = where the receptor is ffor the different modalities
- the **basal axon will travel thru the cribbriform plate to synapse onto the olfactory bulb**
	- this is a thin unmyelinated axon 
	- they travel thru cribiform plate of ethmoid 
	- support cells around it and basal cells around it - **to replace when olfactory cells die off - regeneration takes place**

olfactory epithelium 3 cell types 
- support cells
- basal cells
- olfactory cells 
olfactory receptor cells develop - they will die out 
- and basal cells will mature and then replace them 
- constant turnover like 30-60 days but regen will decline wiht age. 

single olfactory neurons 
- the chemicals **bind to receptors on cilia membrane.**
- majority of receptor population localized to the cilia 

cell responses - cell depol proportional to binding concentration of odorant molecules 
AP frq ofc is proportional to depolarization. depends on the **concentration of odorant molecules**
and greatest depol response = close to the cilia 


olfactory binding proteins
- secreted into mucous , gonna be on its **surface** of nasal cavity and there to bind to and  transport the odorants from air to cilia 

olfactory receptor transductions
- g protein receptors called - G-olf 
- we have more types of these, so many up to 1k types!!! 
- they bind to the molecules that they are most selective for! 
- be aware how specialized these are 
- **molecular shape determines binding**
	- they are selective, if it likes sweet odors it won't bind to musty 
- each olfactory glomerulus gets input from neurons expressing only one type of odorant receptor... each is attuned to specific stimulus 

receptor location 
- distribution will vary greatly, not just huddled in one location, some are more heavily populated and differentialy located based on the taste or modality - chromatographic separation 

when u bind odorant molcules
1. bind to the bipolar olfactory receptor cells to the cilia 
2. going into axons of these -> cribriform plate -> 
3. **glomerulus of the receptors, getting input from one receptor type**-> only respond to one modality 
4. and then the infrmation will go into the tufted/mitral cells (80% are mitral to transmit it to the brain, and tufted would be going back)
	1. these cells **send info thru olfactory tracts into the brain.**
	2. in the olfactory bulb itself we will have the **modding of these diff signals
		1. periglomerular cells would help you focus on what you want to transmit
		2. periglomerular cells = sorta like lateral inhibition 
		3. they're interneurns which regulate which signals they can send out to the mitral cells 
5. mitral and tufted cells have **granule cells which will also regulate the signals**
6. and centrifugal **fibers that come back thru the lateral olfactory tract which can inhibit the olfactory bulb.**

primary olfactory tract projectsion .... 
- piriform cortex = primary olfactory processing center, on the medial side of temporal role... uncus is the medial outjutting of that temporal lobe. 
- olfactory tubercle - odor processing + links to limbic system, 
- will also send directly to amygdala - odor sesnory **emotional**  recall.
- entorhinal cortex = **gateway** to hippoocampus for memory recalll of a smell ; memory recall 
![[olfactory gross anatomy.png]]

downstream targets from the olfactory bulb primary targets:
- to the orbitofrontal cortex via the thalamus  for conscious perception of odor, integrate it taste with other food-related cues = **lots of integration**
- hypothalamus - regulate that emotional response to the smell like with amygdala 
- brainstem reticular formation - autonomic rxn to smell 

from the olfactory bulb there can be **some connection between the contralateral = anterior comissure!**
- to help with smell localization = where is the smell 

trauma affecting olfactory system 
1. anosmia - ability to discriminate odors = can happen due to age or trauma like shearing the nerves from the cribriform plate in brain swaying and the stroke? 
2. chronic rhinitis, smoking, overuse of vasoconstrictors, poppers, cocaine, anything you huff spray paint etc can be dangerous 
3. olfactory epithelium dmg with inhalation of toxic chems, metabolic like thiamine def, adrenal/thyroid def 
4. central dz = **parkinson's, alzheimers, huntingons to stop it**
5. and temporal lobe epilepsy 

aging and olfaction - odor discrim decreases with the age. 
- significant nutritinoal impacts bc they add too much sodium 

1. agnosia - inability to id and name a perceived sensation 
2. parosmia - distortion of odor perception 
3. olfactory hallucinations - common in psych , smell smth that's not there 
4. aura - longlasting lingering smell - **seizure activity beginning in temporal lobe**

early sign of covid
- lss of smell and taste
so the SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by binding to ACE2 receptor proteins, which are:
- expressed in **support cells** and certain stem cells and BV cells but not in the olfactory sensory cells
- note - **olfactory sensory neurons aren't part of the vulnerable population, so infection of nonneuronal cell types mighgt be responsible for the anosmia instead**
- the cell that can grow into the olfactory sensory neurons are impacted
