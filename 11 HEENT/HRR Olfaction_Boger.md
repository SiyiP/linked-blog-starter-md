pair this with taste when doing this. 

- think about the neuron population coming into contact with the environment
- - basically cribriform plate holes let it reach olfaction bulb 
- only one that doens't need to synapse on the thalamus somewhere. 

olfactory epithelium - on roof of nasal mucosa - only volatile chemicals can reach it 
- do some strong inhalations to bind to the receptors 
- our bulbs are small. 
- olfactory nerve is small compared to other species. 

olfactory mucosa - 
- olfactory receptor cells - are bipolar, 
- dendritic ends is with the apical ends, **bulb with cilia extending out into the mucos on the outside**
- cilia = where the receptor is ffor the different modalities
- the **basal axon will travel thru the cribbriform plate to synapse onto the olfactory bulb**
	- this is a thin unmyelinated axon 
	- they travel thru cribiform plate of ethmoid 
	- support cells around it and basal cells around it - **to replace when olfactory cells die off - regeneration takes place**

olfactory epithelium 3 cell types 
- support cells
- basal cells
- olfactory cells 
olfactory receptor cells develop - they will die out 
- and basal cells will mature and then replace them 
- constant turnover like 30-60 days but regen will decline wiht age. 

single olfactory neurons 
- the chemicals **bind to receptors on cilia membrane.**
- majority of receptor population localized to the cilia 

cell responses - cell depol proportional to binding concentration of odorant molecules 
AP frq ofc is proportional to depolarization. depends on the **concentration of odorant molecules**
and greatest depol response = close to the cilia 


olfactory binding proteins
- secreted into mucous , gonna be on its **surface** of nasal cavity and there to bind to and  transport the odorants from air to cilia 

olfactory receptor transductions
- g protein receptors called - G-olf 
- we have more types of these, so many up to 1k types!!! 
- they bind to the molecules that they are most selective for! 
- be aware how specialized these are 
- **molecular shape determines binding**
	- they are selective, if it likes sweet odors it won't bind to musty 
- each olfactory glomerulus gets input from neurons expressing only one type of odorant receptor... each is attuned to specific stimulus 

receptor location 
- distribution will vary greatly, not just huddled in one location, some are more heavily populated and differentialy located based on the taste or modality - chromatographic separation 

when u bind odorant molcules
1. bind to the bipolar olfactory receptor cells to the cilia 
2. going into axons of these -> cribriform plate -> 
3. **glomerulus of the receptors, getting input from one receptor type**-> only respond to one modality 
4. and then the infrmation will go into the tufted/mitral cells (80% are mitral to transmit it to the brain, and tufted would be going back)
	1. these cells **send info thru olfactory tracts into the brain.**
	2. in the olfactory bulb itself we will have the **modding of these diff signals
		1. periglomerular cells would help you focus on what you want to transmit
		2. periglomerular cells = sorta like lateral inhibition 
		3. they're interneurns which regulate which signals they can send out to the mitral cells 
5. mitral and tufted cells have **granule cells which will also regulate the signals**
6. and centrifugal **fibers that come back thru the lateral olfactory tract which can inhibit the olfactory bulb.**
