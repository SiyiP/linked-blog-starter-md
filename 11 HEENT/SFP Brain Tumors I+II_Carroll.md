case 1 
72 yo woman , 1.5 yr hx memory problems - word finding hard + confusion 
very hesitant speech 
see whiteness on the contrast enhancing on the L temporal lobe - 3 masses 
operating room of open biopsy - seen squash prep + frozen section 
	squash prep - cytoogy of iindividual cells
we see neoplasm + evidence of tumor necrosis + thicker BVs
permenant section - superior quality - seen a lot of thickness + neoplasm 
- immunoreactive staine for GFP 
- 5% are p53+ and 12% labeled for Ki67 
- no IDH1 R132H mutation 
dx - glioblastoma 
- impact memory + speech bc it's dominant temporal lobe affecting 
- contrast enhancement - bc of the leaky bvs
- determining prognosis - absence of idh1 r132h mutation 

note:
common types of primary tumors in kids + adults
grading is important and staging is useless for most of these 

WHO classification of tumors of CNS - there's too many... and it's also badly out of date - focus on major concepts + the big common ones 

in adults - glioblastomas GBMs are most common + best studied. 1/3 are malignant + remainder are benign. 
1. glioblastomas - GBMs - we see a crumbly appearance , **ring-enhancing lesion - will not have contrast go into the lesion bc there's a cavity of deead tissue, a ring of necrosis!!**
	1. rapidly growing + diffusely infiltrative, will compress normal parts of the brain 
	2. where do they come from derived from the glia? not neurons probably 
		1. express GFAP = astrocyte markers .... 
		2. but idk not really settled, maybe from more progenitor than the astrocytes
	3. primary GBMs = **de novo... the ppl in 60s/70s**
	4. secondary GBMs - occurs in step-wise fashion , from grade 2 tumors and then will transform . these are typically in 30s/40s. 
		1. diffuse astrocytoma - grade 2. 
			1. diffusely infiltrating astrocytoma that impacts young adults + happens in cerebral hemispheres
			2. high degree of cellular difff, slow growing. 
			3. lacks mitotic activity, vascular prolif + necrosis
		2. anaplastic astrocytoma - G3 
			1. primarly adults + found in cerebral hemispheres ... has more atypia + **brisk mitotic acitivty** but still no vascular prolif + necrosis 
	5. brisk mitotic activity , Kii67 labeling indices are high 
	6. are derived from normal brain, so BBB isn't a huge thing for it 
	7. GBM - have bizzare multinucleated cells (can't divide anymore) and larger numbers of small bipolar cells (can proliferating compoenent)
		1. bipolar cells - > secrete **excitotoxin glutamate which promotes seizures + kills neurons**
		2. the tumor cells are resistant to excess glutamate bc they got bumps so they don't die 
		3. bipolar cells infiltrate very widely - making it **impossible to get a complete surgical resection!**
	8. tumor cells -> grow so rapidly, killing itself, making bland infarc centers 
	9. they make **tumor infarction, pseudopalidsading necrosis!!!**![[Screenshot 2025-11-03 at 1.48.55 AM.png]]
	10. pseudopalisading - as the cells die, the tensile pressure is lost then the cells collapse upon itself 
	11. hypoxic penumbra around that zone is crammed more and more so more VEGF is made, so **vascular endothelial proliferation glomeruloid bodies are made...**
	12. this is why it's contrast enhancing bc of the leakiness 
	 grading:1 is the best, 4 is the worst. this is strictly for this tumor... but we don't grade the pituitary adenomas 
	 - this is strictly based on histo and molecular features, ignoring the clinical ones. 
	 - GBMs - are grade 4, bc ppl typically die 12-14 mon post dx 
	 - but staging - assesses lymph nodes. + metastases.... and extraneural metastases are very rare for GBMs. 

 glioma - a collective term - any nervous system tumor from astrocytes, ependymal cells or oligodendrocytes 
 - glioblastomas + astrocytomas = 75% of all gliomas in adults 
 - oligodendrogliomas, mixed gliomas or whatever are majority of other 25% 

2. oligodendroglioma - myelinated glia in the CNS... also seen **calcifications!!!**
	1. fried **EGG APPEARANCE due to artifact**
	2. they will lack marked atypia, brisk mitotic rate, vasc prolf + tumor necrosis 
	3. they are only grade 2 
	4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">codeletion of 1p and 19q</mark> - better survival + 
3. anaplastic oligodendroglioma - grade 3 
	1. more mitotic activity, cells that look like minigemistiocytes
	2. hypercellularity, vasc endo prolif + tumor necrosis 
	3. from the progression 
	4. tumors will contrast enhance all while showing evidence of intratumoral calcificatons

4. primary CNS lymphomas - arises AIDs patients are here
	1. associations with b-cell lymphomas + association with EBV infection 
	2. **perivascular pattern of growth**
The cancer genome atlas - 
- ot id the molecular abnormalities and stuff. 
- you need to see which subgroups you can look at 
- TCGA.  = 4 GBM subtypes - proneural, neural, classical, mesenchymal 
	- **IDH1 = novel oncogene .... if you have mutation here your survival is better**
	- changes the function of the enzyme - makes alc metabolite - which will change the epigenetics. 

integrated dx - we will use molecular and histo reasons to classify patients. no more mixed gliomas.

memory issues, 38 yo, confused + blunted affect + no focal deficits
- contrast enhancing lesion of left frontal lobe infiltrating into dura, extending into ventricular system + crossing corpus callosum 
- nests of tumor cells - **sharply demarcated from adjacent tissue... CK7, GATA3, e-cadherin, high mitosis + extensive necrosis**
- **metastatic breast cancer** = this is metastasis bc 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">well circumscribed, so since they're from outside the braint hey're not able to infiltrate the brain that well.</mark>
	- multiple lesions 
	- at gray-white junctions ; on the other hand gliomas are more in the white matter. 
	- large numbers of mitotic figures are present

benign CNS tumors in adults 
1. meningiomas - are over half of these, the majority 
	1. adheres to the dura, ar dural based masses
	2. **on radiology they appear to be in the lateral ventricle!!**
	3. enduce hyperostosis of skull  - thickened skull bone
	4. can cause marked edema in adacent brain - 
	5. grade 1 = don't invade brain but do aggressively invade bone + soft tissues
	6. primarily surgical but sometimes radiotherapy 
	7. come from **arachnoiid cap cells in leptomeninges** - thinking they have whorls of neoplastic arachnoidal cells - > 
	8. psammoma bodies ![[Screenshot 2025-11-03 at 2.15.28 AM.png]]
	9. atypical meningioma - grade 2 , wil invade the brain 
		1. markedly inc risk fo recurrence but isngificantly inc death rate 
		2. not whorled anymore but a lot of cells 
	10. malignant meninigioma 
		1. rare highly aggressive
		2. excessive miitosis + anaplastic 

2. pituitary adenomas - super common 
	1. they are intrasellar tumors from hormone secreting cells of **anterior pituitary**
	2. hormone secretion + clinical symptomsor mass effect not secretors 
	3. cannot be predicting by histo - that's why we don't use WHO 

3. schwannomas 
	1. benign **periipheral nerve sheath tumors** - grade 1 
	2. commonly occur in **8th !!! cranial nerve and spinal cord nerve roots but happen on any nerve**
	3. symptoms related to which cranial nerve they're on ... like hearing loss on the 8th or pain on the dorsal spinal nerve roots 
	4. these are composed exclusively of **neoplastic schwann cells, which aren't true of the other pierpheral nerve shealth tumors like neurofibromas and mpnsts**
	5. don't infiltrate nerve!!!! they are **encapsulated masses and push on that nerve to dmg it, never will transform**
	6. treat : surgery 
4. craniopharyngiomas - grade 1 
	1. 2 major types: 
	2. adamantinomatous - in kids - epithelial **sellar region - which will compress the optic chiasm, so pituitary dysfunction, visual symptoms and can press on CSF so hydrocephaluous**
		1. note - contrast enhancing 
		2. partilaly calcified
		3. partially cystic 
		4. **state of utah crystals are seen = rhomboidal**
	3. papillary craniopharyngiomas - in **adulthood**
		1. above the sellar, or 3rd ventricle!!! 
		2. present with similar symptoms - 
		3. but **different epithelium - lacking the stratum granulosom...**

NS neoplasms in KIDS!
CNS - **this is the most common neoplasm 
in younger ones - gliomas are common**

1. pilocytic astrocytoma - grade 1 
	1. this is in the cerebellum but happen anywhere... including the optic nerves 
	2. this is a cyst with a mural nodule 
	3. **this is biphasic, dense and loose areas!! these don't progress unlike other astrocytomas**
	4. rosenthal fibers (red rods) + microcytts
	5. ![[Screenshot 2025-11-03 at 2.37.36 AM.png]]
	6. but they do have proliferation of vascular - contrast enhance. 
	7. significance - optic stuff = think NF 1 
2. ependymomas - rare in adults common in kids
	1. grade 2 
	2. from ependymal ceells which line the ventricles
	3. slow growing, lack high mitotic activity, vascular endothelial prolif, and necrosis
	4. uniform looking at a cellular level 
	5. in central canal, obstruction of CSF flow 
	6. can progress to anaplastic ependymoma - grade 3, unfavorable prognosis with inc cellularity, brisk mitosis,vascular endothelial prolif 
3. embryonal tumors - high grade 4, 
	1. medulloblastomas - from cerebellum, 75% ini vermis, sporadic- **don't memorize these genetic syndromes...**
		1. 5% associated with genetic syndromes
		2. extend into 4th ventricle , obstructive hydrocephalous + inc Intracranial pressure with headache, vomitting, truncal ataxia 
		3. **solid, contrast enhancing masses**
		4. hypercellular, super packed, and given a lot of **blastic** of cells 
		5. one exception - **staging is here**
			1. these can drop metastasize.. via the CSF, so we can see if there's chunks of tumors distal to where it breaks apart 
	2. primitive neuroectodermal tumors PNETS 
		1. from cerebral hemiispheres
		2. well-circumscribed, **variably** contrast enhance + has cysts, calciication + hemorrhage
		3. no genetic syndromes
		4. **these are aggro ):**
		5. this is a catch-all we need to break these into subtypes 
syndromes of NS neoplasia - 
4. Neurofibromatosis 1 
	1. most common affecting human nervous system 
	2. CNS neoplasms 
	3. non CNS neoplasms  - juvenile chronic myelogeous leukemia, sarcomas 
	4. pigmented lesons - cafe au lait etc , lisch nodules 
	5. bony dysplasia , shortening of bone in forearm, skulls base etc. 
	6. learning disabilities - not mental disabilities, **no qualify for the special ed ):**
	7. neurofibromas - kids aren't born with it, they develop in puberty ; some hormone connection 
		1. dermal neurofibromas - no malignant potential 
		2. plexiform neurofibromas - are born w/ these, occur **internally, in large nerves or nerve plexuses**
			1. these CAN **transform into aggro schwann cell derived malignacies known as MPNS1s... wich are mmost common malignancy and leading cause of death in NF1 patients**
	8. ): quality of life is bad in plexiform neurofibromas , where we can get chunks removed via surgery 
5. Neurofibromatosis 2 - central ... 
	1. schwannomas - happening - these pts are prone to deafness
	2. schwannomas are everywehre in the brain 
	3. AD and in 1 in 40k - 50k 
	4. NF2 gene lifespan is shortened 
	5. NF2 gene -> encodes protein known as merlin/schwannomin which **mediates communication bt cell surface membrane of cytoskeleton**

non-NF2 schwannomatosis 
- not far from NF2 affected gene on th chromosome are nstead causing schwannomatosis called **LZTR1 or SMARCB1 on 22q as well**
- these don't have the bilateral acoustic schwannomas, meningiomas or ependymomas.. but schwannomas elsewhere which make intratable tumor-related pain ; super pain ): 
- some cliniicals that overlap with NF2-associated schwannomatosis 
- we need to test all 3 genes to fully distinguish 

1. tuberous sclerosis complex TSC 
	1. famiilial but like 60% sporadic 
	2. AD inheritance
	3. 2 loci 
		1. TSC1 = hamartin 
		2. TSC2 = tuberin 
		3. mutations -> hyperactivation of mTOR
	4. seizures = most common CNS manifestation followed by intellectual disability 
	5. unpredictably distrib hamartomata - happen in many organs with brain + kidney most involved 
	6. 2-10% of subependymal lesions in brain progress to bcome brain tumors 
	7. we see tubers - potato-like things appearing - **the seizure foci**
	8. candle gutterings = subependymal nodules in the ventricles !!! can progress to become subependymal giant cell astrocytomas ![[Screenshot 2025-11-03 at 2.56.40 AM.png|345x296]]
	9. SEGAs -  subependymal giant cell astrocytomas = associated with ventriculomegaly + are often calcified
