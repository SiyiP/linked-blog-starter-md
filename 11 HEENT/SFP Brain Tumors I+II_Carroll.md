#HEENT #patho 

case 1 
72 yo woman , 1.5 yr hx memory problems - word finding hard + confusion 
very hesitant speech 
see whiteness on the contrast enhancing on the L temporal lobe - 3 masses 
operating room of open biopsy - seen squash prep + frozen section 
	squash prep - cytoogy of iindividual cells
we see neoplasm + evidence of tumor necrosis + thicker BVs

permenant section - superior quality - seen a lot of thickness + neoplasm 
- immunoreactive staine for GFP 
- 5% are p53+ and 12% labeled for Ki67 
- no IDH1 R132H mutation 
note:
common types of primary tumors in kids + adults
grading is important and staging is useless for most of these 

WHO classification of tumors of CNS - there's too many... and it's also badly out of date - focus on major concepts + the big common ones 

in adults - glioblastomas GBMs are most common + best studied. 1/3 are malignant + remainder are benign. 
1. glioblastomas - GBMs - we see a crumbly appearance , **ring-enhancing lesion - will not have contrast go into the lesion bc there's a cavity of deead tissue, a ring of necrosis!!**
	1. rapidly growing + diffusely infiltrative, will compress normal parts of the brain 
	2. where do they come from derived from the glia? not neurons probably 
		1. express GFAP = astrocyte markers .... 
		2. but idk not really settled, maybe from more progenitor than the astrocytes
	3. primary GBMs = **de novo... the ppl in 60s/70s**
	4. secondary GBMs - occurs in step-wise fashion , from grade 2 tumors and then will transform . these are typically in 30s/40s. 
		1. diffuse astrocytoma - grade 2. 
			1. diffusely infiltrating astrocytoma that impacts young adults + happens in cerebral hemispheres
			2. high degree of cellular difff, slow growing. 
			3. lacks mitotic activity, vascular prolif + necrosis
		2. anaplastic astrocytoma - G3 
			1. primarly adults + found in cerebral hemispheres ... has more atypia + **brisk mitotic acitivty** but still no vascular prolif + necrosis 
	5. brisk mitotic activity , Kii67 labeling indices are high 
	6. are derived from normal brain, so BBB isn't a huge thing for it 
	7. GBM - have bizzare multinucleated cells (can't divide anymore) and larger numbers of small bipolar cells (can proliferating compoenent)
		1. bipolar cells - > secrete **excitotoxin glutamate which promotes seizures + kills neurons**
		2. the tumor cells are resistant to excess glutamate bc they got bumps so they don't die 
		3. bipolar cells infiltrate very widely - making it **impossible to get a complete surgical resection!**
	8. tumor cells -> grow so rapidly, killing itself, making bland infarc centers 
	9. they make **tumor infarction, pseudopalidsading necrosis!!!**![[Screenshot 2025-11-03 at 1.48.55 AM.png]]
	10. pseudopalisading - as the cells die, the tensile pressure is lost then the cells collapse upon itself 
	11. hypoxic penumbra around that zone is crammed more and more so more VEGF is made, so **vascular endothelial proliferation glomeruloid bodies are made...**
	12. this is why it's contrast enhancing bc of the leakiness 
	 grading:1 is the best, 4 is the worst. this is strictly for this tumor... but we don't grade the pituitary adenomas 
	 - this is strictly based on histo and molecular features, ignoring the clinical ones. 
	 - GBMs - are grade 4, bc ppl typically die 12-14 mon post dx 
	 - but staging - assesses lymph nodes. + metastases.... and extraneural metastases are very rare for GBMs. 

 glioma - a collective term - any nervous system tumor from astrocytes, ependymal cells or oligodendrocytes 
 - glioblastomas + astrocytomas = 75% of all gliomas in adults 
 - oligodendrogliomas, mixed gliomas or whatever are majority of other 25% 

2. oligodendroglioma - myelinated glia in the CNS... also seen **calcifications!!!**
	1. fried **EGG APPEARANCE due to artifact**
	2. they will lack marked atypia, brisk mitotic rate, vasc prolf + tumor necrosis 
	3. they are only grade 2 
	4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">codeletion of 1p and 19q</mark> - better survival + 
3. anaplastic oligodendroglioma - grade 3 
	1.
