#HEENT 


inflammatory conditions
common: famiy practice 
1. canker sores + aphthous ulcers
	- large, multifocal, erythematous rim and a whitish membrane on top of the lesion 
	- can be in tongue, hurts a lot , can be any location 
	- no great etiology , but they're small to large. 
	- recurrent too - gluten sensitivity association? 
2. herpetic lesions - HSV-1 
	1. might have prodrome like itching and scratch pain 
	2. virus is in dormant in ganglion and recure
	3. it's called Tzank prep in blister phase. we see a vesicle, we'd rupture it and then smear onto a slide the contents
	4. ulcer post rupture is in red 
	5. **primary herpetic gingivostomatitis** - diffuse involvement across oral cavity, association with illness + can be all over soft palate. 
	6. inside the vesicle in the blister phase 
		1. we see grnaulation tissue, acantholytic cells + blister lumen - viral inclusions 
		2. **glassy inclusion = multinucleated <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">polykaryon</mark>!**
3. candidiasis - curd-like plauqes ith erythematous base. 
	1. abundance ovoid bud yeast forms ; pseudophyphae
	2. little punctate hemorrhage sites underneath the plaque on clinical exam 
	3. seen in oral in immunosuppressed + diabete - oportunistic 
	4. chrronic candidiasis can happen in oral in immunosuppressed. hard to treat bc uncontrolled systemic dz or hygiene can't be controled 
4. AIDs - we see Hairy leukoplakia
	1. corrigated plaques most commonly seen in lateral tongue
	2. little slots on the side 
	3. ![[Screenshot 2025-10-24 at 1.46.44 PM.png|220x239]]
	4. need biopsy in this case. in histo: see EBV!!! clear cells underneath the surface 

premalignant conditions
- risks for neoplasia in HEENT - tobaco, snuff, radiation, hardwood dust, alc, viruses, heavy metals
- airway/gastric passages can get inovlved. 
- in nasopharynx - thre's fossa of rosenmuller = particular tumor risk. 
- waldeyers ring = tonsillar tissue going from adenoids to around ... a circle
1. leukoplakia - whitish welll defined mucosal patch or plaque caused by epidermal thickening/hyperkeratosis. can be broad etiology - need histo - malignancy risk is very low. 
	1. if found in buccal- look for if there's anything causing the epithelium to keratinize by irritating the skin - is there a denture or dental work? 
	2. how to tell the dif bt hairy and leukoplakai 
	3. **leukoplakia is speckled!** and hairy is more corrigated
	4. this is more serious risk of malignancy - leukoplaktic and erythropakia esp with speckles. 
	5. white patch, 3-25% go thru transformation 
2. erythroplakia - super significant for malignancy - oral cancers seen in tongue cancer and huge ... do it doesn't matter age grouping or anything 
	1. dysplastic and molecular changes seen with more and more stuff... this is def maybe next in a malignancy sequence 
3. we see a change in oral cavity - with vast majority of oral cancers being oropharygeal cancers and less oral cavity cancers. 
	1. less than 50% survival 5 years
	2.  lip > floor of mouth > lateral tongue 
	3. for sc - we have a heavy risk - bc lip cancers are common 
- know what lymp node drains 
	- pair of parotid + jugular digastric empties tonsillar crypt area of the oropharynx
	- lip drains to submental lymph nodes 

malignant epithelial conditions of oral cavity 
1. squamous cell carcinoma of the lip = sun dmg, crust in the lower lip 
	1. lip carcinoma - invasive squamous - we see a rolled edge, perineural invasion means surgery is harder to do ): 
	2. overall think of this as a retromolar pad or a pad of something 
	3. limp draining ot submental and **upper lip to the preauricular node** 
2. tongue carcinoma initial dx is 50% have pooz rgiona lymp nodes. 
	1. young females under 40 no risks are seen 
	2. tongue cancers - depth of invasion 1.5 will give lymph node dissection risk ): 
3. vital structures next to tongue that are key - all things at risk 
	1. nerves and vessels + cranium access
	2. submentals and jugular digastric is huge for lymph nodes
4. palatal carcinoma - **infrequent lymph node metastases**
	1. reverse smoking putting burning end in mouth with the smoke. they put burning on inside from other parts of world 
5. retromolar trigone area - posterior to molars, anterior to tonsillar crypts
	1. frequently involves the tonsils + may spread parapharyngeal area via nerves 

salivary gland benign/malignant conditions
non-neoplastic 
1. mucocele - translucent blue dome, easily traumatized like biting the lip. seen commonly on tongue 
2. bilateral parotid enlargement
	1. mumps - paramyxovirus= it hurts 
	2. autoimmune dsialadenititis 
	3. Mikulicz syndrome 
	4. keratconjunctivitis sicca - sjorgrens syndrome - dry eyes and the components of lacrimal glands are destroyed and recurrent infections in that area 
		1. associated with germinal center reaction as well  
		2. the lymphocytic infiltrate will destroy the glands or the acini of them 
		3. lots of crusting! in the saliva and the parotids and everything else 

neoplasias- benign 
1. salivary gland neoplasia 
	1. wharton's tumor in the parotid's gland = Mikulicz syndrome!
		1. which is bilateral wharton's tumors
		2. ask ppl if they smoke 
		3. a benign papillary cystadenoma containing many lymphocytes - common salivary gland neoplasm that's benign 
2. palatal pleomorphic adenoma - most common benign tumor - happens in any mouth gland.
	1. polymorphic adenoma - raised soft tissue bump 
	2. can be in kids and adults
	3. well circumscribed, mixed material in it 
	4. capsule around the tumor, they try to get as much out as possible but there's a lumpy bumpy capsule so sometime they can't and make it seed instead.
	5. recurrenc rate
malignant
3. mucoepidermoid carcinoma - most common malignant salivary gland tumor 
	1. and children too 

lower + upper airway benign and malignant conditions 
1. bacterial epiglottitis - life threatening, cause H. influenza
	1. distress + drooling + SOB
	2. seen a radiologically expanded nasal pharynx 
2. croup-viral infetion - laryngotracheobronchitis
3. acute laryngitis - inhalation of irritants or due to allergies
upper respiratory tract 
adenoids - looking into the nasal cavity 
symptomes of:
4. nasopharyngeal carcinoma - associated with the EBV
	1. in china it's more frequent 
	2. hearing loss, ottitis media, epistaxia, discharge from nose, obstruction + anosmia, and speech hyponasal, horner's syndrome, CN deficits, palatal paralysis 
	3. bimodal distrib, ppl form 15-40 and then 50-80 
	4. **all are squamous cell carcinomas - differentiation would be paralleling viral load, like undifferentiated = lots of EBV, so very radiosensitive uckily**
	5. early symptoms = include palatal paresis - think referred pain lymph node metastases
		1. **unique pattern:** <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">think pposterior triangle referred pain!</mark>
	6. very undifferentiated type of tumor, no keratin production and messy cells 

5. laryngeal polyps - benign soft tissue swellings
	1. chronic irritation aka singer's nodule - what adele had
	2. hoarsness is common symptom 
	3. see some bump on the vocal cords. and some are larger and need it removed. 
	4. histologically they have some BVs maybe = some issues with bleeding 
	5. other one - has a myxoid pattern , many different patterns
6. Laryngeal papilloma
	1. benign epithelial neoplasm assocated with HPV 6/11 both juvenile or adult
	2. in kids = think of getting it via vaginal delivery 
	3. looks like papillary trees
	4. issue - this is recurrent, they need removal to speak and breathe. virus doesnt get cleared. 
	5. basically this looks like a bumpy white fruit inside the larynx... can go into the pulm parenchyma ): 
	6. there's some transformations too sometimes malignant! if they smoke or do something else they get compound infection 
	7. symptoms of dysphonia, dysphagia, respiratory problems + referred pain to the otalgia - the ear 
	8. in true cord - can treat with just radiation 
	9. but if superglottic in rich lymphatic field, there's a lot of metastases, so we ned to scope it out 
	10. also ppl with reflux - risk of chronic irritation therefore this.
