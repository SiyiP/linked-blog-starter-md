bounds of scalp
supraorbital region (ur eyebrows) extending to posteriorly the superior nuchal lines of occipital bone 
and laterally to the **zygomatic arch**

superiormost aspect of skull = **vertex**

scalp has 5 layers, use acronym SCALP
- skin - has hair follicles, sweat, sebaceous glands. 
- connective tissue, dense
	- cutaneous nn and bvs are running thru this layer
	- there's septa **anchoring skin to aponeurosis**, like scalp lacerations bleed so much bc of these , so these will contribute to that 
	- orientation of this contributes 
- aponeurosis (between the occipitofrontalis m)
- loose CT - occupies subaponeurotic space
	- **danger - communication of vv facilitates easy spread of infection with an emmensary vein, spreading that infection**, from superficial to deep 
- pericranium - periosteum lining outer surface of skull bones 
3 superficial most layers = move as a unit, like when u pull hair or furrow brows. these are things that are taken off when "scalped."

occipitofrontalis 
- 2 frontal bellies
	- origin from skin + superficial fascia of supraorbital region
	- aponeurosis insertion!!!
	- innervation by **CN VII, temporal br of facial nerve**
	- sometimes called "frontalis /:"
- occipital bellies - posterior part of head
	- origin superior nuchal line
	- to insert aponeurosis
	- diff br of **facial nerve, posterior auricular branch**
	- helps wrinkle the skin at the back of the neck??? 

cutaneous nn of scalp
![[cutaneous nn of scalp.png]]
CN trigeminal V1 
- supraorbital 
- supratrochlear n 
before these branches, it will give rise to the frontal nerve, which will traverse the superior aspect of the orbit an then divide! 

CN V2 - maxillary - zygomaticotemporal n will give to zygomatic procss + the small porition of scalp 

mandibular division V3 -> auriculotemporal n, supplies just behind the anterior to the ear and then the temporal scalp 
- find this nerve traveling with **superficial temporal artery just anterior to ear!!! will be relationship to find this**

C2 - lesser occipital n  from Ventral rami = giving behind ear + to the posterolateral 
- greater occipital n from dorsal rami - majority of posterior scalp to midline
![[arteries of skull.png]]
arteries of scalp - rather superficial 
- from br of external carotid , and from common carotid is from brachiocephalic trunk on either side from that aortic arch. 
	- gives all the branchs in neck and face 
	- superficial temporal a - next to the auriculotemporal nerve - anterior to ear
	- posterior auricular a - just posterior to ear
	- occipital a - same region that occipital n is supplying, posterior scalp to midline 
- internal carotid a - no branches, goes to the brain but eventually gives rise to opthalamic artery 
- ophthalmic a - gives to anterior aspect of forehead supratrochlear a and supraorbital a 

veins of scalp - parallel arteries
- supratrochlear v + supraorbital v -> drain **medial to eye and then the facial vein and then drains into the internal juguar vein**
- superficial temporal v from the mid lateral - joins the **maxillary v to to make retromandibular v, making the internal and external jugular vein**
- posterior auricular v - joins behind the ear directly into the posterior division of retromandibular vein, making that external jugular and internal jugular vein 
- occipital v - posterior aspect o scalp, but then drains into a plexus that  ultimately would drain into the internal jugular v or vertebral v 


lymphatics - no nodes in scalp 
but there's lymphatic vessels which will take the things to submandibular nodes, parotid nodes draining superorbital region + anterior of scalp 
- mastoid node sdraining lateral scalp 
- occipital nodes - drianing posterior 

all nodes drain to **deep cervicla nodes in the neck.**

dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater
- CSF bt arachnoid mater + pia mater. so arachnoid has closer relation to the dura mater. also this houses  BVs that supply brain and spinal cord 
- extradural space = bt the dura mater + inner surface of skull. - **only realized in a pathological situation like blood in skull, not a true functional type of space.**
- **subdural space - deep to the dura, also under pathlogical conditions** 
- epidural space - potential space between the dura + bones of vertebral column.. also pathological conditions 
- arachnoid mater - projects **into the dural venous sinuses, making arachnoid villi!!!**
	- arachnoic granulations will bring CSF from arachnoid spac into the sinuses 
	- lines meningeal dura but no entery to sulci 

cranial dura mater has 2 layers
- extrnal periosteal layer - lines skull, very thin, and meningeal bvs will pass thru this layer. 
- internal meningeal layer - dura of brain makes **reflections** - dense fibrous layer tighlty fused with periosteal layer. 
	- but eventually reflct away to make the reflections like falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli 
	- separate hemispheres 

dura mater at foramen magnum 
- periosteal layer of dura - continuous with periosteum on outer aspect of **calvaria at the forament magnum... not traveling down?**
- foramen magnum  - space at the inferiormost aspect, allowing for spinal cord passage. 
- meningeal layer - continuous with **dura of spinal cord thru the foramen magnum!!!**, travels down a bit more 

4 dural reflections
- horizontal separates **diff funcitonal parts**: 
	- tentorium cerebelli - attaches to he posterior clinoid process of the sphenoid bone, then travels attaching to superior border of petrous part of temporal bone, occipital bone posteriorly , and then  attach to falx crebri 
		- has a free edge - tentorial notch 
		- and eventually travels to anchor itself to the anterior clinoid process part of sphenoid. 
		- entrance - to the cavernous venous sinus - allows passing thru it or the lateral wall. this makes the roof of the cavernous sinus 
	- diaphragma sellae = dural reflection, superior view
		- makes roof over the hypophyseal fossa. 
		- the sella turcica - saddle, a **depression in body of sphenoid, and one of these parts is hypophyseal fossa**
			- first part - tuberculum sellae - a bony prominence on body of sphenoid anteriorly 
			- deepest part of this - where the hypophyseal fossa is , where pituitary gland is residing 
			- posterior aspect -the dorsum sellae 
		- the diaphragma sellae - makes a roof over this, and then has an aperture to passs the **infundibulum/pituitary stalk**
		- optic nerves - CN2 also go thru here. note that **pathologically, if we get a pituitary tumor we can get visual impairments**
		- attachments of this tentorium cerebelli - free edge seen + entryway to the cavernous sinus 
- vertical separates hemispheres-
	- falx cerebri - attaches to frontal crest!! and crista galli (follows the crest on the inside a bit) and attaches to **internal occipital rotuberance**
		- and attach to tentorium cerebelli 
	- falx cerebelli 


dural venous sinuses - venous channels that are made by the **reflections of the meningeal layer from the periosteal layer.**
- also u have dural venous sinuses that will run along the free edge of the dural reflections.. 
- lined with endothelial cells
- drain brain with cerebral veins back to internal jugular vein and down 
- superior sagittal sinus - superior aspect of falx cerebri, from the frontal crest all the way to inferior occipital protuberance
- **confluence of sinuses - where 5 dural venous sinuses drain together**
- wider parts of sinus - call lateral venous lacunae on the sides, 
- finger like projections pusing into the sinus - arachnoid villi - will help CSF fluid into the sinuses to offload. 
- inferior sagittal sinus - free edge of falx cerebri 
	- drains back to straight sinus - in the union of the falx crebri + tentorium cerebelli 
	- takes blood to the confluence 
- occipital sinus - runs in the falx cerebelli also drianing up to the confluence. 

from the confluence - drain bilaterally into **transverse sinuses** posterior aspect of **tentorium cerebelli 
- then transverse sinuses drain into sigmoid sinuses on each side. 
- then they drain into the internal jugular vein. 
passes thru jugular foramen 


cavernous sinuses sitting on sphenoid bone - will have a bunch of sinuses in the midd. 
superior and inferior petrosal sinus will drain the cavernoous sinuses into the sigmoidal?? or transverse veins

cavernous sinus - lateral to the spenoid bone, from superior orbitla fissure to petrous part of temporal bone 
contents - internal carotid a 
CN 6 abducens. 
structures passing thru cavernous sinus 
- internal carotid a and abducens n 
and lateral wall structures
- 3, 4, V1, V2 - opthalamic and maxillary div 
- if you have infection in this space, abducens nerve can get fucked and then eye movement is bad. 

dural sinuses. 
- communicaiton with cavernous sinus: 
- facial vein via **superior oppthalamic vein will connect the 2**
- that infection will spread perfusely bc of the connectios t ot he sup/inf petrosal sinus + pterygoid plexus

![[veins and sinuses of skull.png]]

vascular dura supply 
- getting all blood largley from middle meningeal a, a br of maxillary a . 
- from the terminal br of external carotid a 
- hooks into a space in chek called infratemporal fossa -> gives rise to many br including the middle meningeal a, 
- enters into the cranial cavity via foramen spinosum 

after its entrance into brain, divides into anterior and posterior br 
- other meningeal aa from brs of external carotid  a + vertebral a from other things. - **dont have to know these names**
- note - **pterygion!!** union of frontal, temporal, parietal bone and sphenoid!! - weak site of the skull bc behind it is the **anterior br of meningeal a and middle meningeal a bc if you pterygion the pteryon, this causes a rupture and extradural hematoma**
- just know - the meningeal veins correspond to arteries 

dura innervation 
- CN V1 - > 
	- anterior fossa, posterior fossa + falx crebri from ophthalmic division 
	- if this nerve is referred, it refrs to forehead 
- CNV2
	- middle fossa by the maxillary division
- CN V3 
	- lateral middle + anterior fossa (small portions), this is the maxillary division innervation 
- CN1-3  - posterior fossa together 

ventricles + CSF
- 2 lateral ventricles, a 3rd ventrical and 4th 
- constantly making CSF via choroid plexus 
- dthis drains to 4th ventricle
- 2 apertures in 4th ventricle to have CSF leave into subarachnoid space 
- follow arrows up to the arachnoid granulations to leave subarachnoid to venous sinuses
- venous sinuses to blood. on way to internal jugular v  too. 

lumbar puncture 
- sample CSF
- bt 4 + 5 lumbar vert
- direct access to subarachnoid space 
- **beware - spinal tapping pt with elevated intercranial presusre, causing superior herniation!**

pathology 
1. hydrocephalus - excess cSF in ventricles, dilating it and then seeing in fetus/infant, open suture + fontanelles expand their cavity 
	1. excess choroid plexus CSF prod?
	2. obstructure of flow to subarachnoid space - **most common cause, is obstruction of cerebral aqueduct**
		1. must give a shunt into that ventricle offloading it into the peritoneal cavity 
	3. lack of CSF abs thru arachnoid villi 

2. extradural hematoma - shearing of **meningeal arteries**, 
	1. filling blood bt potential space bt bone + external periosteal dura, typically caused by trauma 
	2. see this lesion - **convex shape into the brain!! and sorta whiteish, shift of falx cerebri away from midline**
3. subdural hematoma - tearing of **cerebral veins**
	1. blood fills space bt dura + arachnoid , 
	2. caused by trauma, excessive movement of brain in cranium 
	3. an older or younger person, like in a car accident with inertia... 
	4. worry for olde rperson bc the cavity has more space for brain to move due to atrophy 
	5. on CT, cresent accumulation, long one, and we see **deviation of LATERAL ventricles away!!!**

4. subarachnoid hemorrhage - rupture of arteries within the brain - internal carotid a, circle of willis 
	1. blood in subarachoid space, the only true functional space. 
	2. cuased by aneurysm + trauma. 
	3. see acucmulation, subarachnoid cisterns contianing blood
	4. worst headache in someones life
	5. typically **fatal and fast**
