nose
- external nose + nasal cavities 
- external nose - nasal bones, frontal processes of maxillae, nasal part of frontal bone, boney part of nasal septum, 5 main lateral cartilages
	- lateral 2 walls, 2 alar, 1 septal cartilages 
- we have 2 external orifices called nares - bound medially by septum 
- nasal cavities - extend anterioorly from nares -> choanae posteriorly 
- these choanae open up into the nasal pharynx. 
- septum divides into 2 halves
- all spaces lined by mucosa 
	- roof - nasal frontal sphenoid + ethmoid bones
		- narrower than floor of nasal cavity 
		- anterior to posterior; 
			- nasal cartilages
			- nasal bone
			- frontal bone 
			- cribriform plate of ethmoid bone = majority. grooves of ethmoid hold **olfactory nerve perforating through**
			- body of sphenoid bone - pituitary gland in hypophyseal fossa 
	- floor - hard palate, roof of mouth 
		- formed anteriorly by **palatine rpocess of maxilla** and posteriorly by the palatine bone 
	- medial = nasal septum 
		- separate r + l nasal cavities, covered by mucosa 
		- anterior - nasal septal cartilage 
		- posterior + **superior = perpendicular plate of ehtmoid bone**
		- posterior + **inferior** = vomer + perpendicular plate of palatine bone 
		- in most ppl septum is deviated 
	- lateral wall = nasal conchae , looks like shelves going into the cavity, Surface area warms and humidifies the air 
		- 3 bony projections. covered and separates canals into **4 air channels:** they house the location of paranasal sinuses where they'll drain 
			- spheno-ethmoidal recess between superior conchae and inferior to rooof of nasal cavity!!!
			- this receives **opening of the sphenoidal sinus**, 
			- ethmoidal bulla - 
		- superior conchae - part of the ethmid bone 
			- superior meatus inf to the superior conchae 
		- middle conchae- part of the ethmoid bone , 
			- ethmoid bulla - the posterior to frontal recess + roof of middle meatus , this is a rounded prominence formed by middle ethmoidal cells , have to flip that middle conchae up... 
				- will receive the air cells ethmoidal ones! 
				- inferior to ths: **semilunar hiatus**, between this and the uncinate process of ethmoid bone - important bc **gets drainage from frontal sinuses + maxillary sinuses** = 
				- ethmoidal infundibulum = anterior end of hiatus, gets drainage from the frontal sinus + anterior cells. 
			- middle meatus - 
		- inferior conchae - it's its own bone... 
			- infrerior meatus 
- nasal atrium - depression **anterior to middle concha, leading to middle meatus**
- nasal vestibule - area inside the nares **leading into the nasal cavity, most outward, lined with skin + hair follicleS!!**

posterior bounds of nasal cavity - 
- posterior boundary is **choanae - posterior nasal apertures**
- oval like openings bt nasal cavities + nasopharynx ; these are rigit + completely surrounded by the bone.... 
- only see middle + inferior concha

paranasal sinuses - paried aras lined with mucosa in interior of frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid + maxilla 
- these are **airfilled extensions of nasal cavity, huge in phonation + reducing weight of skull**
- frontal sinuses near forehead eyebrows
	- within frontal bones, triangular in shape, seen in cross section... remove the calveria 
	- trianglular shaped, and sinus drains thru **frontonasal duct into ethmoidal infundibulum into that semilunar hiatus in the middle meatus!!!!**
	- get innervated by CNV1 , opthalmic nerve , specifically **supraorbital nerve**
	- this is skin innervation to the anterior scalp too 
- ethmoidal sinuses along nose bridge slope 
	- ethmoidal cells - paired, 10-15 cells classically in 3 groups
		- anterior ethmoidal cells- > thru that **frontonasal** duct **into ethmoidal infundibulum** -> in the middle meatus!
		- middle ethmoidal cells -> drains into **ethmoidal bulla** or just above hthis 
		- posterior ethmoidal cells -> open into **superior meatus*
		- get br by V1 **innervated by anterior + posterior ethmoidal nerves**
			- this is a branches of the **nasociliary nerve traversing the orbit**
- sphenoidal sinuses within the body of sphenoid on inside 
	- paired cavities on body of sphenoid 
	- literally right next to the sella turcica , pituitary gland sitting there. 
	- sinuses cause sphenoid bone to be super fragile
	- -> spheno-ethmoidal recess -> superior concha 
	- V1 innervation specifically by the **posterior ethmoid nerve**
- maxillary sinuses on the cheeks/near the nose 
	- in roof of maxillary sinus, formed by floor of orbit 
		- has superior opening, draining -> **semilunar hiatus -> middle meatus**
		- hardest to drain bc the superior opening = has to drain up!!!
	- hard to see in lab 
	- floor  = alveolar part of the maxilla!!!
		- roots of maxillary teeth project onto the floor of sinus bc of close asscoiation 

pathology 
1. sinus dz = sinusitis
	1. can spread from nasal cavities to the paranasal sinuses due to continuity 
	2. infection makes inflammation and swelling of mucosal lining 
	3. maxillary sinuses are most frequently an issue due to superior drainage while head erect + biggest.... also
		1. this can be cannulated and drained by passing cannula from nares thru opening of maxillary sinus! 

blood supply of nasal cavity 
br from either ext/int carotid a 
- ant/post ethmoidal arteries
	- parallels the ant/post ethmoidal nerves
	- these are both **branches of opthalmic a**
	- from the internal carotid a ultimately 
- facial a = br off the external carotid a 
- most big/important = sphenopalatine artery -  terminal br of maxillary a 
	- maxillary a. = an terminal artery of the external carotid. the other one is superficial temporal a which runs with the auriculotemporal nerve instead
	- this maxillary a will swing into the infratemporal fossa + then terminating into sphenopalatine artery, in the pteropalatine fossa 
	- -> sphingopalatine foramen,, gives many lateral + medial wall blood supply 
	- significant amoutn of anastamoses in the anterior nasal septum = **kiesselbach's area = susceptible to nosebleeds via anastamoses here!!!**

venous drainage - parallels arteries
- they drain to pterygoid plexus in infratemporal fossa
- v from anterior nasal cavity drain to facial vein 
- veins paralleling ethmoidal arteries drain to superior opthalmic vein 
- and then off to the **cavernous sinus = potential spread of infection via emissary veins!** potential spread to dural venal sinuses 

nerves of nasal cavity 
- CN 1 - axons of this travel **thru foramina in cribriform plate of ethmoid bone**
	- synapses in olfactory bulb 
	- special sense of smell !! not somatic sensation 
	- **no ganglia, an anterior extension of brain**
	- nasal mucosa divided into 
		- inferior 2/3 of this is respiratory ara to warm and moisten inspired air 
		- olfactory area superior 1/3 of mucosa - specialised. 
- CNV1  - branches of anterior ethmoidal nerve to anterior lateral wall 
	- from the nasociliary nerve of the orbit supplies this more superior aspect of this wall 
- CNV2 - br of infraorbital nerve to anterior lateral wall , supplies anterior inferior aspect ... this is a **continuation** of the **maxillary nerve!**, exits the **infraorbital foramen , supplying the skin**
	- and then gives rise to a branch which enters back into the nare inferiorly! 

posteriolateral wall 
- V2 = posterior superior lateral nasal brs from the nasopalatine nerve via nasopalatine foramen 
- posterior inferior lateral nasal brs - from the **greater palatine nerve which supplies this wall, extending from the pteropalatine ganglion parasympathetic ganglian in pteropalatine fossa, traversing palatine canal and will give rise to these branches**
medial wall 
- from anterior ethmoidal nerve CN V1, anteriorly as a septum branch as the br of the nasociliary nerve in the orbit; this is anterior 
- V2 = nasopalatine nerve will be posteriorly in the medial wall - 
	- coming thru the sphenopalatine foramen 
	- innervate the part of nasal septum and **enters thru the hard palate via the incisive canal**
	- **enters into the oral cavity just posterior to the incisors.**


maxillary division of CN 5 
- trigeminal ganglion -> in series!
	- V1 -> superior orbital fissure
	- V2 -> foramen rotundum ; maxillary n 
		- contineus thru the **pterygopalatine fossa to enter orbit as infraorbital nerve**
			- this pterogopalatine fossa - small space posterio + inf to the orbit + posterior to maxilla 
			- laterally - with infratemporal fossa via pterygomaxillary fissure, this sphenopalatine artery passes thru here. 
			- medially - nasal cavity thru the sphenopalatine foramen 
			- anteriorly - cmmunications with orbit thru the inferior orbital fissure
			- posteriorly - middle cranial fossa thru foramen rotundum 
		- infraorbital nerve** -> pass thru orbit + thru infraorbital foramnen to supply inner wall 
		- ----------------------------
		- meningeal br = supplies senosry innervation to dura in the middle cranial fossa
		- ganglionic branches = 2 brs to pterygopalatine ganglions 
			- autonomics pass thru one of these brs
			- these are in the pterygopalatine fossa, parasympathetic ganglion  
			- many nerves will pass thru without synapsing tho 
			- ptrerygopalatine ganglion - autonomic innervation , get to the lacrimal gland today 
				- preganglionic parasymp fibers from brainstems **superior salivatory nucleus**
				- -> reaches **geniculate ganglion (sensory only and since we're parasympathetic rn we only pass thru)**
				- -> extending is the **greater petrosal nerve** -> joined by the **deep petrosal nerve, the post-ganglionic SYMPATHETIC fibers = plexus gives rise to deep petroosal nerve**
				- deep. + greater petrosal nerve => **nerve of pterygoid canal** = mixed!
				-  **nerve of pterygoid canal** -> pterygopalatine ganglion 
				- PG parasympathetics and sympathetics will go UP to the **maxillary nerve via ganglionic nerves, and then ascend via zygomatic nerve**
				- this zygomatic nerve will connect with V1, which is the opthalmic nerve.. 
				- will reach the lacrimal gland. 
		- greater + lesser palatine nn = **coming out of the pterygopalatine ganglia** ; autonomics + sensory 
			- these are passing inferiorly from the ganglia to enter thru palatine canal 
			- greater one. = > hard palate
			- lesser one = > soft palate 
		- before it continues to infraorbital n - gives rise to the posterior superior alveolar n 
			- this supplies sensory innvervation to the **maxillary sinus mucosa and to molars?**
		-  infraorbital nerve , before it passes thru infraorbital foramen... 
			- 2 branches anterior + middle superior alveolar nn => supplies the maxillary teeth!!!
	- V3 -> foramen ovale
