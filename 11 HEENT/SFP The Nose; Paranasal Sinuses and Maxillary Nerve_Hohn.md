nose
- external nose + nasal cavities 
- external nose - nasal bones, frontal processes of maxillae, nasal part of frontal bone, boney part of nasal septum, 5 main lateral cartilages
	- lateral 2 walls, 2 alar, 1 septal cartilages 
- we have 2 external orifices called nares - bound medially by septum 
- nasal cavities - extend anterioorly from nares -> choanae posteriorly 
- these choanae open up into the nasal pharynx. 
- septum divides into 2 halves
- all spaces lined by mucosa 
	- roof - nasal frontal sphenoid + ethmoid bones
		- narrower than floor of nasal cavity 
		- anterior to posterior; 
			- nasal cartilages
			- nasal bone
			- frontal bone 
			- cribriform plate of ethmoid bone = majority. grooves of ethmoid hold **olfactory nerve perforating through**
			- body of sphenoid bone - pituitary gland in hypophyseal fossa 
	- floor - hard palate, roof of mouth 
		- formed anteriorly by **palatine rpocess of maxilla** and posteriorly by the palatine bone 
	- medial = nasal septum 
		- separate r + l nasal cavities, covered by mucosa 
		- anterior - nasal septal cartilage 
		- posterior + **superior = perpendicular plate of ehtmoid bone**
		- posterior + **inferior** = vomer + perpendicular plate of palatine bone 
		- in most ppl septum is deviated 
	- lateral wall = nasal conchae , looks like shelves going into the cavity, Surface area warms and humidifies the air 
		- 3 bony projections. covered and separates canals into **4 air channels:** they house the location of paranasal sinuses where they'll drain 
			- spheno-ethmoidal recess between superior conchae and inferior to rooof of nasal cavity!!!
			- this receives **opening of the sphenoidal sinus**, 
			- ethmoidal bulla - 
		- superior conchae - part of the ethmid bone 
			- superior meatus inf to the superior conchae 
		- middle conchae- part of the ethmoid bone , 
			- ethmoid bulla - the posterior to frontal recess + roof of middle meatus , this is a rounded prominence formed by middle ethmoidal cells , have to flip that middle conchae up... 
				- will receive the air cells ethmoidal ones! 
				- inferior to ths: **semilunar hiatus**, between this and the uncinate process of ethmoid bone - important bc **gets drainage from frontal sinuses + maxillary sinuses** = 
				- ethmoidal infundibulum = anterior end of hiatus, gets drainage from the frontal sinus + anterior cells. 
			- middle meatus - 
		- inferior conchae - it's its own bone... 
			- infrerior meatus 
- nasal atrium - depression **anterior to middle concha, leading to middle meatus**
- nasal vestibule - area inside the nares **leading into the nasal cavity, most outward, lined with skin + hair follicleS!!**

posterior bounds of nasal cavity - 
- posterior boundary is **choanae - posterior nasal apertures**
- oval like openings bt nasal cavities + nasopharynx ; these are rigit + completely surrounded by the bone.... 
- only see middle + inferior concha

paranasal sinuses - paried aras lined with mucosa in interior of frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid + maxilla 
- these are **airfilled extensions of nasal cavity, huge in phonation + reducing weight of skull**
- frontal sinuses near forehead eyebrows
	- within frontal bones, triangular in shape, seen in cross section... remove the calveria 
	- triangl
- ethmoidal sinuses along nose bridge slope 
- sphenoidal sinuses within the body of sphenoid on inside 
- maxillary sinuses on the cheeks/near the nose
