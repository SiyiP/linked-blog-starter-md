embyology - in frst 8 wks determines the pathway of an anomaly... 
outside = celfts lined with ectoderm 
inertna pouch = with endoderm 
1st one begins 4th week, then later on it's added one by one 
![[derivatives of pharyngeal arches chart.png]]
![[pharyngeal derivatives of pouches and clefts.png]]

first and 2nd branchial anaomalies
- they course deep to the derivative of their own branchial arch + superficial to derivtives of the next one 
- cyst - walled off
- sinus - one opening which ends nto the skin 
- fistula - one opening like tube to another structure
work type 1= ectoderm derived, ust **superficial to the facial nerve, so lateral to it and less common**
work type 2 - more serious - ectoderm + mesoderm derived, lined by sq epithelium + has adnexa + cartilage, course around CN7 is all variable, exiting near cheeck 
- facial nerve runs thru the parotid... so we need to get the superficial parotidectomy to find the facial nerve to remove that cyst or whatever...


2nd branchial anomalies - this is more commoon 
- basically fistula anterior to SCM , deep to platysma and facial nerve is the cyst
- bt the external + internal carotid 
- lateral to CN 9 + 12 , medial to posterior belly + digastric + stylohyoid 
- tonsillar fossa = the true fistula will end in the **2nd pharyngeal location with that tonsillar fossa**
- assoiations: with branchiootorenal syndrome, preauricular pits/tags, auricular deformities, deafness, temporal bone anomaliieis 

external ear - 
- ear modeling - cartilage is superrr variable and flexy 
- at 4-5 years = 80% of adult size and at 9 it's adult size
- lobule - fibrous tissue and fat 
- 3 extrinsic muscles 
- made during week 7 
- 1st branchial arch -> 1st hillocks of his -> tragus + helix 
- 2nd branchial arch hillocks 4-6 -> antihelix + antitragus , 
- ![[embryological dev of external ear.png]]
- arrsst can happen anytime - with microctia
1. microtia - mostly sporadic maybe insjury to the stapedial artery or some teratogenic 
	1. grades 1-4.... 4 = no sears. 1 = **floppy stick out ears**, 2 has all structures but small. 3 = some cartilage but requires reconstructure
	2. always look for hearing !! conductive hearing loss like in grade 3 needs hearing age 
	3. prominorris - having all the structures, but most cartilage is missing, might need or want otoplasty with some cutting of skin 
	4. grade 3 - options for treatment would be hearing aid, observation - waiting to do surgery? prosthetic management, reconstruction with autologus rib graft + medpor(3d printed with temporoparietal fascial flap)
		1. prosthesis harder - to incorperate atresia repair + cost + maintenance 
	5. observation til 5-8 years old ++ allows bone browth of ribs + development of contralateral **normal ear**
	6. we should **repair microtiia external ear before atresia**
- often: kids who have this have **oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum = OAVs**
	- hemifacial microsomiia 
	- dysplasia
	- mandible twisted, 2nd most common 
	- facial asym, epibulbar dermoids 
	- mandibular hypoplasia, coloboma 
	- affected side might be subtle 

1. **treacher collins syndrome** aka mandibulofacial dysostosis 
	- TCOF1 locus on chromosome 5 
	- **bilateral symmetric involvement**
	- slanting palpebral fissures, lower lid coloboma 
	- oribtal rim defects
	- malar hypoplasia, ear anomalies, inc hearing loss
	- micrognathia - breathing problems + cleft palate; hard to intubate them ): 
	- cog development = normal 
	- first thing to help - with airway, then feeding, then hearing later on 

2. robin sequence
- the chin /jaw s really recessed, hard to breath, pushed back and hard for them to breathe. 
- you lift them up or put them on their side or prone 
1. pierre robin sequence
	1. mandibular hyplasia be4 wk 9 
	2. 	4. glossoptosis - posterior displacement of the tongue, the palatine plates and stuff would be placed too far back, from the ceiling in the medial area downwards... so cleft palate is made 
	3. triiad: miicrognathia, glossoptosis, airway obstructure with cleft palate 73-90% U shaped , wide cleft palate 
	4. difference from above robin - the time line ,,, one thing that causes cascade of events 

airway + feedings
- positioning, oxygen, retintion 
- bicarb, flexible laryngnoscopy, eating enough 
- genetiic onsultation for associated syndromes
- **stickler syndrome CT disease with joints and 22q11.2 deletion most common**
- trach for kids with airway stuff, but theres other things : 
conservative 
- positioning, nasopharyngeal airway placement, CPAP + supp o2 
- surgical: 
	- tracheostomy, tongue lip adhesion, mandibular distraction osteogeneiss
	- MDO = will directly address primary problem of micrognathia and long term benefits by lengthening the mandible - one way to elongate the jaw 
	- will implante a device, in planning be careful of the lymph nodes 
	- some complication rates 20-30%  - the devce goes in slowly with teh screws!
	- pins come out and slowly move the jawforwards - like **braces but with the mandible with lengthening**
- need long term follow up for MDO 

embryology of cleft lip + palate
4-8 wks gestation - lip + primary palate first which forms laterally 
8-12 wks = gestation - secondary palate , incisive foramen 
![[palatal development timeline chart.png]]

- most common congen malformation after club foot 
- 80% unilateral 20% bilateral
- bilateral cleft lip 
- complete - involvs the alveolus **and nasal floor**
- incomplete - does'nt involve the nasal floor 
classifications 
veau classification 
- type 1 - cleft of soft palate only 
- type.2 = clefts of hard + soft palate restricted to secondary palate - palate posterior to incisive foramen 
- 3 = unilateral cleft involving 2ndary + primary palate - this is atnerior to incisive foramen 
- 4 = bilateral cleft w complete median tubercle isolation 
orbicularis oris 
- this will have abnormalities in here
goals of cleft care
- growth + development
- social acceptance 
- speech dev  - like hypernasal speech , too much air going thru the palate. 
- dental + skeletal alignment - teen yars ortho ppl and bone grafft for when they're older 
ultrasound - hard to see this 

at birth - main goal is to airway, growth, feeding, and genetic eval 
- cleft palate would have more fluid = higher risk of otitis media bc th levator will open up to the ear 
- **avoid feeding tubes if we don't need**
- need special cleft feeders bc we cna't mkake suction ... so high failure to thrive
- cleft lip only = no need for it 
- cleft lip + alveolus - possible? **attempt moms feeding method + monitor closely weight**
- cleft palate -w/ or w/out lip - special accoms needed + cleft palate bottle need+ at risk 

taping - birth -5months 
NAM - nasoalveolar mlding - with a device where you bring out the premaxilla - surgical with taping+ lip repair . 

cleft lip repair - rule of 10s
- 10+ wks
- 10+ pounds 
- 10+ hgb. 
- rules - function to repair orbicularis sphincter and do aesthetics 

cleft palate repair 
- 9-12 mons 
- try to close + elongate the palalte to get muscles realigned for speech 
submucous cleft palate - 
- bifid uvula
- zona pellucida - blue area 
- notched hard palate 
-
