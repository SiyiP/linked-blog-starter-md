inf with trachea and opens into pharynx posterior and inf to tongue + oropharyngeal isthmus 
- suspended from hyoid superiorly + attached to trachea inferiolry 
- very mobile in neck, moved superiorly/inferiorly as well as ant/post by action of extrinsic muscles 
larynx - voice production/phonation 
- closes valve of lower resp tract during swallowing to maintain patent airway 
- open valve during respiration 
- can be palpated inf to hyoid + deep to infrahyoid mm 
- deep to lateral lobes o thyroid gland 
- laryngeal prominence protrudes bt infrahyoid mm 
- C4 = superior margin f thyroid cartilage and bifurcation of common carotid artery 
- C6 = cricoid cartilage, larynx continuous with trachea 
- muscles:
	- 3 unpaired cartilages = 
		- cricoid
		- thryoid
		- epiglottis
	- 3 smaller cartilages = help vocal ligaments move and make diff sounds 
		- arytenoid
		- corniculate
		- cuneform 
	- fibroeleastic membrane + muscles
