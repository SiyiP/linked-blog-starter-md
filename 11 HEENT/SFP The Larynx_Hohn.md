#HEENT #anatomy 

inf with trachea and opens into pharynx posterior and inf to tongue + oropharyngeal isthmus 
- suspended from hyoid superiorly + attached to trachea inferiolry 
- very mobile in neck, moved superiorly/inferiorly as well as ant/post by action of extrinsic muscles 
larynx - voice production/phonation 
- closes valve of lower resp tract during swallowing to maintain patent airway 
- open valve during respiration 
- can be palpated inf to hyoid + deep to infrahyoid mm 
- deep to lateral lobes o thyroid gland 
- laryngeal prominence protrudes bt infrahyoid mm 
- C4 = superior margin f thyroid cartilage and bifurcation of common carotid artery 
- C6 = cricoid cartilage, larynx continuous with trachea , and beginning of esophagus  
- the laryngeal inlet - communication bt laryngopharynx + larynx 
	- anteriorly = has the epiglottis
	- laterally = aryepiglottic folds
	- posterior/inferior = interarytenoid fold 
- muscles:
	- 3 unpaired cartilages = 
		- cricoid - most inferior, surrounding the trachea, looking like a signet ring
			- has a borad poterior potion of lamina 
			- and front part is thinner 
			- 4 articular facets ,
			- 2 on the poterior superior, the **artenoid cartilages**
				- they are paired, has base + apex 
				- base of arytenoid cartilage sitting on the lamina posteriorly, articulating with the cricoid cartilage 
				- apex = project superiorly and articulates with the **corniculate cartilages**
				- muscular process - will project **laterally -  site of attachment for cricoarytenoid muscles** + lateral cricoarytenoid mm 
				- vocal process. - projects anteriorly vocal ligament attaches here. 
			- then the 2 on the posterior inferior, articulating w the thyroid cartilage or inferior horn 
		- thryoid - largest, union of 2 broad lamina  , converges antriorly but open postriorly 
			- the laryngeal prominence is the anteriorly where it comes together = this is the adams apple 
			- superior + inf thyroid notch in the front is made
			- horns = are **posterior!!! jutting out in the back.**
				- superior horn extends into the lateral thyrohyoid ligaments, and both inferior horns have a facet with the cricoid to make cricothyroid joint 
				- oblique line bt the inf horn and the anterior = tis is site of attachment for 2 infrahyoid + inf pharyngeal constrictor mm 
			- vocal ligaments - on the inside of anterior wall of thyroid 
		- epiglottis- leaf shaped - 
			- attaches via hypoepiglottic ligament ot hyoid bone
			- and thryoepiglottic ligament attaches it to thyroid cartialge 
			- epiglottis diverts food + liquid away from largyneal inlet during swallowing 
	- 3 smaller cartilages = help vocal ligaments move and make diff sounds 
		- arytenoid
		- corniculate
		- cuneform 
	- fibroeleastic membrane + muscles 
membranes
- attach larygneal cartilages to one naother to hyoid view
- thyrohyoid membrane - bt tyroid cartilage + hyoid bone 
	- lets passage laterally for **internal br of superior laryngeal n or internal laryngeal n**
	- and the superior laryngeal a from the superior thyroid artery 
- fibroelastic membranes have 2 parts- 
	- quadrangular membrane will connect the epiglottis to arytenoid 
	- and inferior free edge is thick and **vestibular ligament** = which is covered by the folds aka vestibular folds if covered by mucosa
	- conus elasticus - from thryoid cartilage to the cricoid cartilage - thickening anteriorly to make **median cricothyroid ligament** aka membrane 

laryngeal membranes
- quadrangular membrane - wraps around the side of airway, along edge of epiglottis, lower edge = vestibular lig 
	- as it drapes, will make vestibular ligament ("false vocal cord" up higher than the true vocal cord)
- conus elasticus - extending up from the cricoid cartilage wrapping up around the airway -> free margin to make the **vocal ligament!! on the upper edge!** 

folds define 3 major spaces
- vestibule = superior to the vestibular fold, posterior to the epiglottis and bound by the epiglottis making the space
- between the  vocal folds like the vestibular folds + vocal folds form the conus elasticus we have the **laryngeal ventricle**
- infraglottis space = inferior to that true vocal fold , leads us into the trachea

synovial joints of larynx 
- cricothyroid joint - bt inf horn of thyroid cartilage + cricoid cartilage 
- allows the lengthening of the vocal ligaments, which vibrates to make higher pitch. 
- enables thyroid cartilage to move forward + tilt 

- cricoarytenoid joint  - bt base of arytenoid + superior surfac of cricoid lamina 
- rotation of arytenoids + sliding = either abd or adduct the vocal folds!!
- you would abduct the vocal ligaments for *respiration* 

space bt the 2 true vocal folds = the **rima glottidis**
- the true ones = are white bc less vascular 
- more lateral = false vocal folds made by the vestibular fold 
- adducting = swallowing 
- abducted = breathing 
- narrowed = phonation bc they rub together 
- 2 parts of the rima glottidis
	- interligamentous - anterior 3/5, bt vocal folds 
	- intercartilaginous. - posterior 2/5, bt vocal processes of **arytenoid cartilages!!!**
	- recall; the arytenoid cartilages rotate, allowing for variable opening 
normal resp - 
- narrow rima glottidis 
- wedgeshaped , medially slightly rotated in arytenoid cartilages
forced resp
- wide rima glottidis
- arytenoid cartilages abducted, laterally rotate
phonation 
- both the interligamentous and intercartilaginous elements are closed
whispering
- arytenoid processes are fully rotated, closing the interligamentous portion and opening the intercartilaginous portion 
- why need to do that? passing it thru **just the intercartilaginous portion to make air whisper**

extrinsic muscles of larynx 
- move **larynx up or down** as a unit during swallowing 
- elevators - mostly **suprahyoid mm** conveys force to the larynx through the thyrohyoid membrane!
	- stylohyoid 
	- digastric
	- geniohyoid
	- mylohyoid
- one infrahyoid muscle bt hyoid + thyroid cartilage 
	- thyrohyoid 
- depressors of larynx - 
	- infrahyoid muscles : 
		- omohyoid
		- sternohyoid
		- sternothyroid

- closing th largyngeal inlet  = actions of the intrinsic muscles
- the intrinsic ones also adj tension in voals, open/close the rima , and control vestibule size
3 close the laryngeal inlet- all in posterior view 
- aryepiglottic part of oblique arytenoid m - criss cross, lateral to that aryoepiglottic folds 
- oblique arytenoid m - criss cross fibers more inferior to the aryepiglottic part 
- transverse arytenoid m - running transversly in the horizontal plane underneath 
upward movement by extrinsic muscles during swallowing to help close airway + open pharyngeal end of esophagus 
-
cricothyroid - only intrinsic muscle on anterior side f larynx 
- not covered by mucosa
- rotats/pulls bilateraly the **thyroid cartilage anteriorly + down, inc tension of vocal ligaments to make a higher pitch!!!**
- innervated by external br of superior laryngeal n from CN X 

thyroarytenoid 
- this will shorten and widen the vocal ligament , making it more relaxed and do lower sounds
- pulls thyroid + arytenoid cartilages closer together. - innervation recurrent laryngeal n 

vocalis 
- this will shorten and widen the vocal ligament , making it more relaxed and do lower sounds
- tesnes anterior + relaxes the posterior vocal ligament = specific to this one 
- innervation recurrent laryngeal n 

lateral cricoarytenoid - attaches to superior surface of cricoid cartiage => muscular process of arytenoid cartilage
- to adduct vocal folds, medially rotate arytenoid cartilages
- making you whisper 
- recurrent laryngeal n CN X 
posterior cricoarytenoid - from posterior surface of cricoid lamina -> muscular process of arytenoid cartilagee
- will laterally rotate arytenoid cartilages to **abduct the vocal folds, the only one**
- innervated by recurrent  laryngeal n CN X 
transverse arytenoid muscles
- posterior surface of arytenoid cartilage -> posterior surface of opposite arytenoid cartilage to **pull arytenoids closer adduction to close vocal folds**
- - innervated by recurrent  laryngeal n CN X

innervations - vagus all innervation!
CN X branches
- superior laryngeal n - divides in the neck, branching into: 
	- internal laryngeal n - sensory to laryngeal mucosa above vocal folds, will be piercing the membrane , moves with the superior laryngeal artery  
		- terminal br of superior laryngeal n 
		- passes anteroinferiorly to penetrate thyrohyoid membrane
		- deep to the mucosa of piriform recesss 
		- sensory to laryngeal mucosa down to vocal folds 
	- external laryngeal n - motor , travelling on the inferior pharyngeal constricto m to cricothyroid muscle; the superior thyroid artery travels with this 
- recurrent laryngeal n - one on r and l, recur by coming back up and ascend 
	- L - around aortic arch 
	- R = loop around 1st part of R subclavian a 
	- while they ascend, provide **sensory to larygeamucosa below the vocal folds**
	- and then the motor to all intrinsic nerves except cricothyroid
	- ascends in tracheoesophageal groove to -> larynx deep to inferior pharyngeal constrictor 
	- will pass below thyroid gland, entering into the larynx deep to that muscle 
- vagus n 
- ![[laryngeal nerves from vagus branches.png]]

blood supply of larynx - 
superior 1/2 = superior laryngeal a 
- br of superior thyroid a 
- pierces thyrohyoid memb with int laryngeal n 
infeirior 1/2 
- inf laryngeal a a branch of the inf thyroid a 
- entering posterior to inf horn of thyroid cartilage with recurrent laryngela n 

important surg relations = will 
- external laryngeal n + superior thyroid a 
- recurrent laryngeal n with the inf thyroid artery 
	- this nerve is deep to artery or mayb  superficial or may pass thru branches of artery 
lymphatics - heading to deep cervical nodes

- L recurrent laryngeal nerve. - loss of voice
- in thorax 
	- mediastinal tumor, carcionma , stretche d over **aortic arch aneurysm, mitral valve stenosis enlarging LA**
- in neck: 
	- both L/R , thyroid carcinoma / malignant lymph nodes 
- nerve dmg = 
- complete division of ext laryngeal n 
	- loss of cricothyroid m 
	- loss of tensioning of vocal cord
	- weakness in phonation, monotonic 
- complete division of recurrent laryngeal nerve
	- paralysis of muscles that abduct / adduct, 
	- vocal cord on affected side is inn neurtral 
	- weakness in phonation not total loss
- bilateral paralysis 
	- - can't abduct - restricted resp/stridor 
	- can't adduct = voice nearly absent
