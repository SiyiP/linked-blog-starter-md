arbovirus = acronym for arthropod borne virus - 
- from mosquitos, fleas, etc. things that suck blood; has a tropism for the CNS 
- extrinsic incubation period - time from acquisition of pathogen by vector until it infects the human ; for the mosquito to get the virus and then be able to bite and infect
- intrinsic incubation period - time from infection of the human until symptoms start 
an uninfected arthropod **cannot bite an infected person and IMMEDIATELY transmit disease to another person**

vectors - mosquitos, flies, sandflies, lice, fleas, ticks, mites

they are seasonal but there's ways they persist thru the cold/dry seasons
- transovarial transmission - eggs live
- overwintering/hibernation of infected adult/larva arthropods
- vertebral reservoirs wit sustained viremia - mice, snakes. birds
- basically all infected adults of arthropod vector can be killed + virus wont be elim !!!
![[zoonotic CNS viruses transmitted by arthropods chart.png]]

bunyavirus - california/lacross virus is the only -ssRNA env

humans are dead-end hosts ; all infections are acute and majority are **asymptomatic.**
- viral replication at site of bite in macrophage/monocytes - > amplified mononuclear phagocyte system + viremia 
	- it can stop here = asymptomatic
- crossing BBB via neural pathways -> meningeal inflam, -> aseptic meningitis -> neuronal necrosis with inflammation = **fever + encephalitis**
	- directly kills neurons or cytokines that eventually kill them 
1. west nile virus - flavivirus
	1. primarily birds; bitten by mosquitos - all types pretty much 
	2. worldwide
	3. then bird to humans by mosquitos
	4. human-human transmission via blood transfusion, transplacental, breast milk, organ transplants 
	5. 80% no symptoms 
	6. 20% west nile fever - abrupt fever/chills/headache, **morbilform rash, retroorbital pain, 3-10 days**
	7. <1% have neuro dz = **inc with age and immunosuppress, fatal or long term**
		1. meningitis or encephalitis. or **acute flaccid paralysis in 48 hrs** <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">mimics polio... but in older ppl</mark>
	8. dx - clnical, CSF PCR, arbovirus panel,
	9. TREAT: no treatment 
	10. prevent with insect repellent 
2. zika virus 
	1. transmit - mosquitos **aedes + sexual + congenital**
	2. 3-14 days incubation 
	3. in adults - fever, rash, myalgia, headaches, conjunctivitis, mild 2-7 days 
	4. **guillain barre syndrome in adults. = classical ascending paralysis + preserved sensation... but areflexia**
		1. thought that the zika polyprotein has high peptide overlap w/ myelin+ axons, causing this autodimmunity
	5. encephalitis, myelitis, etc = rare in adults
	6. in kids -> fetal = **hepatosplenomegaly, cns manifestations, retinal/optic nerve dz, arthrogryposis! congenital infections**
	7. DX: PCR 14 days, and trioplex RT-PCR 
3. equine encephalitis virus
	1. togavirus
	2. reservoir birds - transmitted by mosquitos to humans+horses as dead end hosts
	3. in north america 
	4. DX: serology IgM 
	5. TREAT: nothing specific
	6. eastern EE: 
		1. more systmic febrile illness
		2. fevr, headache, gi 
		3. in 5% progression to EEE, sezures, confusion, disablity, death in 5 days 
		4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CSF = neutropils and proteins up, and glucose down or normal</mark>
	7. western EE
		1. mostly asymptomatic... 
		2. acute fever and small stuff
		3. but worse in kids - seizures, confusion, coma, etc 
		4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CSF: more opening pressure, lymphocytes + proteins. and normal glucose</mark>
4. japanese encephalitis- SE asia
	1. Flavivirus; rainy szn 
	2. culex mosuqitos to birds or swine
	3. 75% infections < 14 yo 
	4. 90% asymptomatic , 10% febrile 
	5. 1% encephalitis - abrupt, 30% mortality, 30% perm impairment ; similar to parkinsonium 
	6. DX: exposure hx, lab igM eliza 
	7. **need vaccine before exposure to agricultural SEA area**
5. st louis encephalitis virus 
	1. flavivirus, same mosquito vectors as West nle
	2. americas 
	3. <1% infected show symptoms 
	4. age 60+ = worse
	5. if symptomatic can cuse <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">SIADH -> hyponatremia... treatment with ifn-alpha can help</mark>
	- syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone 
6. lacrosse encephalitis virus/california virus
	1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">bunyaviruses -ssRNA</mark>, can change quickly 
	2. mosquito aedes born 
	3. in midwest, central + southeast us 
	4. common in kids 1-15 yo 
	5. most asymptomatic 
	6. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">symtomatic - hyponatremia + neuroinvasive + arbovirus</mark>
	7. DX: igM + CSF -<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">normal glucose, higher lympohcyte+proteins</mark>
7. tick borne meningoencephalitis virus
	1. flaviviruses, fromo ticks. in europe, russia, asia
	2. ixodes tick - **vector similar to lyme dz**
	3. 90% asypmtomatic
	4. biphasic
		1. initial flu like symptoms + fever
		2. 8 days later fever free + inc in temp afterwards
		3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">2nd phase of fever = onset meningoencephalitis </mark>
^^these viruses can only be prevented 
8. alpha gal syndrome - 
	1. not an infection but an allergy to<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose found in most mammals </mark>but not rpimates
	2. **associated with bites of lone star tick**
	3. can't eat flesh or milk from mammals! including gelatin! 
	<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">4. **includes any food allergy symptoms ! some ppl are forced to become vegetarian!!!</mark>**
		treat with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">antihistamines</mark> and avoiding triggers

mmamals 
1. lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus  LCMV= <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">arenavirus</mark> 
	1. mice mainly - 5-10% house mice are infected
	2. transmission via infected aerosilized urine 
	3. biphasic
		1. 8-13 incubation
		2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fever, myalgias, headaches, n/v for 7 days</mark>
		3. then recovery for<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> 1-2 days</mark>
		4. then <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">meningitis/encephalitis </mark>
	4. autumn to winter = season 
	5. LABS: 
		1. **phase 1 - leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, livers up**
		2. phase 2 <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CSF protein high glucose low</mark>
	6. DX: clinic + ELISA
2. hantavirus- also transmitted by rodent urine
	1. this is also <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">biphasic</mark> with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">simiilar phase one</mark>
	2. the difference is that this phase 2 is **hantavirus <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pulmonary</mark> syndrome with 30% mortality**
	3. and this is mostly out in the west = 4 corrners region 

Rabies - rhabdoviridae
- worldwide
- bullet shaped capside
- host = any mammal
- transmission via saliva. 
- vaccines work for all strains of rabies 
- pathogenesis 
	- enveloped, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">single neg stranded rNA virus </mark>
	- local replication -> peripheral nerve fibers get it via the NMJ -
		-then it goes to the spinal cord, -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">brain gray matter</mark>
	- jumps nerve to nerve til extension via autonomic nervous system
- incubaton period long time - 1-3 months!!!
- takes less time if bitten on face vs bitten on foot
- **binds to Ach receptor of peripheral nerves -> migrate retrogradely along axonal microtubules using motor proteins**
- diencephalon, hippocampus, brainstem first involved 
	- unable to swallow, mentla status bad 
	- once symptomatic, 100% mortality 
- if not treated...
	1. encephalitis furious rabies - 
		1. autonom nervous activation - excess of motor activity, agitation, arrythmias, salivation/sweating, foaming at mouth , hallucinations
	2. paralytic dumb rabies
		1. progressive symmetric or focal flaccid paralysis + coma 
		2. resp paralysis -> death 
1. DX" only antemortem. 4 specimens needed - serum, saliva, CSF, skin 
2. on the biopsy we see **negri body**, the eosinophilic inclusion in cytoplasm and skin - densely enervated 
3. PEP = 
	1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">human rabies immune globulin into the bite w</mark>ound 
	2. AND h<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">uman diploid cell inactivated rabies virus vaccin</mark>e - **multiple doses are needed.**
