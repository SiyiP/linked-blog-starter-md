look at how they group it

**• Tick-borne encephalitis virus group**  
• Human Immunodeficiency virus

herpesvirus)

Bold: in this lecture

zoonotic CNS 
• Rabies virus

virus group  
• Herpes B virus (macaque herpesvirus)

non-zoonotic CNS viruses

• Mumps (meningitis)

arbovirus = acronym for arthropod borne virus - 
- from mosquitos, fleas, etc. things that suck blood; has a tropism for the CNS 
- extrinsic incubation period - time from acquisition of pathogen by vector until it infects the human ; for the mosquito to get the virus and then be able to bite and infect
- intrinsic incubation period - time from infection of the human until symptoms start 
an uninfected arthropod **cannot bite an infected person and IMMEDIATELY transmit disease to another person**

vectors - mosquitos, flies, sandflies, lice, fleas, ticks, mites

they are seasonal but there's ways they persist thru the cold/dry seasons
- transovarial transmission - eggs live
- overwintering/hibernation of infected adult/larva arthropods
- vertebral reservoirs wit sustained viremia - mice, snakes. birds
- basically all infected adults of arthropod vector can be killed + virus wont be elim !!!

bunyavirus - california/lacross virus is the only -ssRNA env

humans are dead-end hosts ; all infections are acute and majority are **asymptomatic.**
- viral replication at site of bite in macrophage/monocytes - > amplified mononuclear phagocyte system + viremia 
	- it can stop here = asymptomatic
- crossing BBB via neural pathways -> meningeal inflam, -> aseptic meningitis -> neuronal necrosis with inflammation = **fever + encephalitis**
	- directly kills neurons or cytokines that eventually kill them 
1. west nile virus - flavivirus
	1. primarily birds; bitten by mosquitos - all types pretty much 
	2. worldwide
	3. then bird to humans by mosquitos
	4. human-human transmission via blood transfusion, transplacental, breast milk, organ transplants 
	5. 80% no symptoms 
	6. 20% west nile fever - abrupt fever/chills/headache, **morbilform rash, retroorbital pain, 3-10 days**
	7. <1% have neuro dz = **inc with age and immunosuppress, fatal or long term**
		1. meningitis or encephalitis. or **acute flaccid paralysis in 48 hrs** <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">mimics polio... but in older ppl</mark>
	8. dx - clnical, CSF PCR, arbovirus panel,
	9. TREAT: no treatment 
	10. prevent with insect repellent 
2. zika virus 
	1. transmit - mosquitos **aedes + sexual + congenital**
	2. 3-14 days incubation 
	3. in adults - fever, rash, myalgia, headaches, conjunctivitis, mild 2-7 days 
	4. **guillain barre syndrome in adults. = classical ascending paralysis + preserved sensation... but areflexia**
		1. thought that the zika polyprotein has high peptide overlap w/ myelin+ axons, causing this autodimmunity
	5. encephalitis, myelitis, etc = rare in adults
	6. in kids -> fetal = **hepatosplenomegaly, cns manifestations, retinal/optic nerve dz, arthrogryposis! congenital infections**
