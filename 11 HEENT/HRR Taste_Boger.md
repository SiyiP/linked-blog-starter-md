viscerosensation - the solitary nucleus would be receiving mechano and chemosensory from the periphery 

note - the taste buds are also in the epiglottis - in the trenches of papillae - a fluid type substance stimulates them.
taste transducers are activated + 3 main papillae
- fungiform = in the anterior part of tongue, sweet salty 
- folliate - middle 1/3. = salt predom 
- circumvallate = sour bitter modalities near the posterior - for toxic substances

ther's some regional specifivity due to expression of that transducer cells
- but not really that specific but selective, you can still taste stuff in toher areas

taste buds
- taste transducer cells within those buds.
- need entrance thru taste pore -> taste transducers
- support cells. + basal cells are there
- tight junctions hold these together
- when modalities bind, it'll have the transducer cells take information down the axons of the 7th CN 
- basal cells differentiate to replace transducer cells. like olfactory the ability to repop decreases with age. 
- taste buds = most dense on tongue but also on palate + gingiva
- the ones in posterior + palate + gingiva = more high sensitivty to sour + bitter. 
- large dental appliances can mask these tste buds /: complaints abt food being bland 

afferent pathways
anterior 2/3 - facial nerve sensory = fungiform 
- will travel back to chorda tympani -> facial nerv 
- 
posterior = 1/3 = glossopharyngela nerve CN 9 
- circumvillate + foliate 
- bitter and sour 

phayngeal taste buds = all the way back into the pharynx = vagus nerve
- epiglottis information 
- relayed to brainstem 
all 3 nerves
- synapse in the **solitary nucleus rostral component in the medulla!!!**

unlike the olfactory system where one receptor responds to just their specific modality - 
- we not only have that but the **taste buds have a variety of taste transducer cells**
- **whatever predominant taste transducer cell has one modality make the largest response!!!**
- some are mixed responses too 
- also afferent axons respond to many modalities 

taste receptors - speciic to modalities itself, taste receptors are SPECIFIC
- types of modalities are selective of it 
models of taste coding 
labeled line theory 
- one neuron tuned for one modality narrowly, and it sends information deep into the brain only and sends it 

across neuron pattern - ANP - having neurons broadly turned to multipel qualities and are interconnected along the axis after initially getting signal to the taste receptor = dominant theory 

neural coding. - mix of the 2 afferent fiber responses 
- ANP does dominant tho 
some fibers have hard time discriminating bt submodalities 

central connections via 3 CNs depending on location = **thes are ipsilateral**
- all 3 synapse in the rostral solitary nucleus
	- recall = the **caudal solitary nucleus will bring in visceral info instead**
	- caudal solitary nucleus will also send information into the  limbic areas... with **fibers going thru the parabrachial nucleus in the brainstem**
	- parabrachial nuc sends that visceral info to hypothalamus + amygdala. 
- then the information goes to the thalamus VPM - ventral posterior medial nucleus 
- then take it to the **insular taste cortex**
- and some others take it from the VPM to the **frontal taste cortex/frontal operculum**- the parts that make that lateral fissure. 


note - the solitary nucleus's rostral side can 
- also send information to the hypothalamus - viseral autonomic responses ; sweating from spice 
- amygdala - > the limbic system ; which is emotional, really happy doing this
solitary nucleus - huge for viseral information too!!!
- gets sensory input 
- sends information with hypothalamus + cortical regions to integrate that information with others to get the most appropriate behavior 
- drives autonomic responses by communicating with other brainstem nuclei with **reticular formations + parabrachial nuclei which are coordinated with short term reflexes + patterns**

taste + aging 
- taste changes - buds will decline 
- gum dz too affets this - poor teeth + periodontal dz reduce appetite
- dificulties - low/inc appetite . or excessive seasoning unfort. 
- actions = attractive food presentation inc  person's willingness to eat - and separte food rather than mixing to vary texture
- have good dental care 
- and eat together! to let ppl enjoy eating more
