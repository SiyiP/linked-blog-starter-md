- The **middle meningeal artery**, a branch of the maxillary artery, enters the skull through the f<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">oramen spinosum</mark> and runs within the outer periosteal layer of dura.
- . Scalp lacerations are known to bleed profusely. One reason for this is that the septa are positioned in a way that hold the vessels open allowing continued blood flow.
- The<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> abducens nerve (CN VI)</mark> runs <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">**through** the cavernous sinus alongside the internal carotid artery. </mark>It is often the first nerve affected in cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Other structures that may be affected include CN III, CN IV, CN V1, and CN V2, which run along the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus to reach the orbit.
-  The facial vein communicates with the ophthalmic veins, which drain into the **cavernous sinus**. Spread of infection through these valveless veins can cause cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Abducens nerve (CN VI) is most vulnerable as it travels through the cavernous sinus

The buccal nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve that transmits sensory information from the skin of the cheek area and the oral mucosa of the cheek.

This function distinguishes the V3 buccal nerve from the buccal branch of the facial nerve (VII), which is a motor nerve that innervates the buccinator and the muscles of the upper lip. The buccal branch of the facial nerve does not have a sensory component.

The inferior alveolar nerve is another branch of V3. It enters the mandibular foramen where it provides sensory innervation of the mandible and all the mandibular dentition. This nerve is anesthetized when dentists perform work on the mandibular teeth.

The lingual nerve, also a branch of V3, transmits general sensation from the tongue. The lingual nerve also receives the chorda tympani, a branch of the facial nerve, that provides the lingual nerve with preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the submandibular ganglion. After synapsing there, postganglionic parasympathetic fibers carry secretomotor to the submandibular and sublingual glands.

The mental nerve is a branch of V3, from the inferior alveolar nerve, that provides sensory innervation to the skin of the lower lip and chin.

The buccal nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve that transmits sensory information from the skin of the cheek area and the oral mucosa of the cheek.

The TMJ can dislocate anteriorly due to excessive contraction of the lateral pterygoid muscles. So the answer is against the anterior side of the articular tubercule, which would be accomplished by anterior movement of the jaw beyond its normal position.

The external acoustic meatus is posterior to the normal position of the mandible. This is not a location for anterior displacement of the TMJ.

In the normal position, the head of the mandible is in the mandibular fossa and near the posterior aspect and on the surface of the articular tubercule.

In the normal position, the head of the mandible is in the mandibular fossa and near the posterior aspect and on the surface of the articular tubercule.

The mandibular notch is the space between the coronoid process and the condylar process of the mandible. This is not a place where the mandible can dislocate.

The TMJ can dislocate anteriorly due to excessive contraction of the lateral pterygoid muscles. So the answer is against the anterior side of the articular tubercule, which would be accomplished by anterior movement of the jaw beyond its normal position.


The temporalis muscle, particularly its posterior fibers, is one muscle responsible for retraction of the mandible.

The lateral pterygoid protracts the mandible – pulls it forward.

The masseter elevates the mandible.

The medial pterygoid also elevates the mandible.

The mylohyoid elevates the hyoid bone and the tongue and depresses the mandible.

The masseter elevates the mandible

The masseter, medial pterygoid, and temporalis are muscles that elevate the mandible. These muscles receive motor innervation from V3, the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V).



 The lesser petrosal nerve is a branch of the **glossopharyngeal** nerve (N IX). The lesser petrosal nerve carries **presynaptic parasympathetic** fibers to the otic ganglion. These fibers synapse in the **otic** ganglion and the postsynaptic fibers travel **on the auriculotemporal nerve to provide secretomotor innervation to the parotid gland.**

The **ciliary ganglion receives preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the inferior division of the oculomotor nerve (CN III)**. Postganglionic fibers from the ganglion travel by the s**hort ciliary nerves to innervate the sphincter pupillae and the ciliary muscle of the eye.** Sensory and sympathetic fibers also pass through the ciliary ganglion and travel on the short ciliary nerves but do not synapse in the ganglion.

The g**eniculate ganglion is the sensory ganglion of the facial nerve**. The cell bodies of the neurons that carry **taste sensation from the anterior 2/3 of the tongue** are in this ganglion.

The **submandibular ganglion receives preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the chorda tympani**. The postsynaptic fibers from the submandibular ganglion carry s**ecretomotor innervation to the submandibular and sublingual glands.**

nerve to the mylohyoid, which is a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve. The inferior alveolar nerve is a branch of the mandibular division (V3) of the trigeminal nerve (CN V).

The geniohyoid muscle is innervated by the ventral primary ramus of spinal nerve **C1** via fibers carried by the **hypoglossal** nerve. The geniohyoid muscle spans from the mental spines of the mandible to the body of the hyoid bone. It elevates the hyoid and depresses the mandible.

The **hyloglossus** is a muscle of the **tongue** that is innervated by the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII).

The **stylohyoid** muscle is innervated by the facial **nerve**. It spans from the styloid process to the hyoid bone. It elevates and retracts the mandible.


The chorda tympani exits the skull through the petrotympanic fissure. The petrotympanic fissure is a fissure in the temporal bone that permits passage of the chorda tympani into the infratemporal fossa. 

**The foramen lacerum is an artifact of a dried skull. In life, it is closed by cartilage; nothing is transmitted through this foramen.**

The foramen spinosum provides passage of the middle meningeal artery and vein and the meningeal branch of V3 into the middle cranial fossa.

The facial nerve (CN VII) passes through the stylomastoid foramen.

The maxillary artery is one of the terminal branches of the external carotid artery. It enters the infratemporal fossa as the major source of blood for the region.
