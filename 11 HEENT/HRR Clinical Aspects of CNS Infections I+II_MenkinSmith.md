rewatch this if you ever wanna do lumbar puncture again 

approach in Emergency med
ABCDE appraoch - how to present all ur cases
Airway
breathing
circulation
disabiliity GCS = glasgow coma score used in trauma, and mental status too 
expose 
ABCDE clear => more detailed h+p 

cass of pts with headaches - who wants to tap or lumbar tap that 
case 1 
- 46 yo male fever. + headache - in bed lethargic with one 
- ABC ntact
- GCS 14/15 sligtly confused 
- severe headache + nausea 
- fever + tachycardic 
- diffferentials - **lethargic + mental status = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">bacterial meningitis - death in 50% overall, very can't miss</mark>**
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">in the us, s. pneumoniae + n. meningitidis are 2 major community acquired ones</mark>
	1. kids: <1 mo - GBS, e. coli 
	2. 1-4 mon - e coli, GBS
	3. 3 mon - 18yo = N. meningitis, s. pneumon, h. flue 
	4. in usa adults:
		1. strep pneumoniae
		2. n. meninigitis 
		3. **listeria monocytogenes, esp in 50+**
1. meningococcal meningitis - 
	1. huge n vaccines and here too in all adolescents and stuff
	2. the belt - extends from senegal to ethiopia highest incidence 
	3. systemic infection + bacteremia = fever, myalgia, rash
	4. as bacteria penetrate BBB + CSF -> meningial inflammation with neck stiffness, photophobia, headache
	5. may see cerebral vasculitis + elevated icp, seizures, focal deficits, cn palsies!!! 
	6. **they get sick quickly: fever, nuchal rigidiity, change in mental status**
		1. headahe is 50% sensitivity 
	7. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">having a neisseria rash!!! = petechia = with vessel reakdown which evolves into purpur</mark>a! 
	8. **kernig sign= extend the knee, poz w/ resistance to extension or pain**
	9. **brudzinski sign = flex head towards the chest, poz with flexion of the KNEEs + hips of patient automatically**
		both are signs of the meninges pulling and hurting 
		- this is only 5% sensitive, should raise concerns for them having meningitis if they have it 
- they should get a lumbar puncture here. in this case while starting antibiotics. but if you give antibiotics before u may not be able to culture it afterwards due to timing. 
	- in adults, bt L3-5 ... match with the posterior iliac crest. 
	- position them with lateral decubitis, open up the spaces by bending into fetal position. 
	- in obese patient,s have them do seated position - with bedside table with pllow to curl over. 
	- go further than u think ... esp in bigger and heavier ppl 
	- pop sensation entry into subarachnoid space or giving sensation - should see CSF
	- attach sterile manometer to measure **opening pressure**
		- normal opening pressures are <20 cm H2O 
		- huge in cyrptococcal meningitis dx. 
		- 2 ccs fluid into each tube 
	- they should lie flat 
	- RISKS = coagulopathy -> hematoma 
	- thrombocytopenia + other bleeding
	- **if they got raised ICP, there's a pressure that they can herniate the brain down due to obstruction!!!!**
this is mortality in lumbar punctures. 
abnormal CT fnidings with meningitis - with focal findings on exam, 
- 60+ yo 
- immunocompromise
- hx of CNS dz 
- hx seizure within 1 wk before presentation 
- neuro deficits too 
you need thsese findings to see something on ct 
- give **vancomycin + 3rd gen cephalosporin like ceftriaxone**
- steroid use. = helps out with reduction in hearing loss + other complications in s. pneumoniae especially!
	- there's dec inflammation - decreased vancomycin penetration unfortunately 
- with household ppl after finding it 
- **give wife and close contacts chemoprophylasix!!!!**

case 2 
72 yo nursng home patient 
- lethargic, oriented to person, neck pain + headache 
- + neck stiffness
- give a **Ct of head + blood cultures + give antibiotics**
- C<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">T before LP if they are </mark>= 
	- immunocompromized 
	- hx CNS dz 
	- seizure within 1 wk 
	- papilledema
	- abnormal lvl of consvciousness
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> focal neuro deficit </mark>
- CSF: we see protein, CBC with differential, glucose, and g-stain + culture 
- we need cell count in CSF to still be able to dx this 
- empiric antibiotics = **for older pts 50+ or babies <3 mon, consider adding ampicillin in case it's listeria**
- elevated WBC seen
- normal CSF should have : 
	- <6-25 cmh2o 
	- 70% lympocytes, 30% monocytes
	- occasional solitaryeosinophil/PMN seen 
	- 0-5 cells / uL WBC ; so 6+ is abnormal 
- that being said, we can have some traumatic taps where we nick a blood vessel on puncture
	- 1000 RBCS = correlates to 1 WBC, so subtract however many thousand RBC from the total WBC count 
classic bacterial meningitis
- elevated wbc count, 1000 + usually neutrophillic too 
- elevated protein 250  + 
- low glucose below 45 mg/dL 
viral encephalitis 
- atlered cerebral function 
- depends on season + epidemiology with location considering mosquitos 
- HSV encephalitis - is 10-20% of cases 
	- HSV 1 = 90% 
	- rapid fever, headache, seizures etc + neuro signs + aloc 
	- imging = temporal lobe encephalitis
	- TREAT: IV acyclovir 
	- **altered cerebral function**

CASE 3 
- 20 yo fever + headache, uri 10 days ago, fever + headache 1x / week with fever persisting 
- ABC intact
- D neurologically intact, meningismus present =  triad (3-symptom syndrome) of nuchal rigidity (neck stiffness), photophobia (intolerance of bright light) and headache.
- pcr = enterovirus! 
1. viral meningitis - typically fine and can be dischardged
	1. usually enterovirus, parechovirus, 
	2. hsv 2 
	3. arboroviruses like west nile 
	4. CSF: elevated WBC + lymphocytic more... 
	5. 2/3 patients with enteroviral meninigitis have PMN prominence early on 
	6. take sex hx for hsv
	7. empiric acyclovir maybe 
	8. **lethargic but still normal brain function!!! aseptic meningitis**

cas 4 
premie
22 yo wth fever, complicaion SVD with pprom 
sleeping more and poor feeding + temp elevation 
1. neonatal meningitis pathophysiology 
	1. 1st mon of lif = **most common for bacterial meningitis compared to any other period of life**
	2. group b strep = GBS
	3. e coli too 
	4. RFs: low birth weight, premie, premature/prolonged rom, materanal infection 
	5. better intrapartum antibiotics are good
	6. mortaility and morbidity high
	7. nonspecific = **fever + hypothermia, irritability ... some have bulging anterior fontanelle/meningismus but these are too late**
		1. any fever necessitates testing for this 
	8. LP = go lower, for the L4 space... bc sc extends longer in neonates. 
	9. they have cell count 15+ .. protein 100+ in term and 125+ in preterm 
- any infant 21 days and younger gets a septsis work including LP + empiric antibiotic coverage
	- ampicillin + gentamycin 
	- of meningitis suspected or dx
		- ampicillin + cefotaxime

CNS infections part 2 
case 5 
- 20 yo hiv+ male , not on HAART
- ABC intact
- D = eyes open to pain, moans, localizes GCS 9 , moves all extremities 
- temp is febrile
thinking about any cns infection
ct no acute abnormalitie 
opening pressure - 50 cm H2O
1. **cryptococcal meningoencephalitis**
	1. inhaled from soil = bird droppings
	2. pneumonialike illness like coug, fever, chest
	3. can disseminate into CNS
	4. 80% no neck stiffness
	5. insidious over 1-2 weeks
	6. aids defining 
	7. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">elevated opening pressure, (normal is usually lees than 25)</mark>
- mononuc predom, csf more varied tbh 
- gold standard; **india ink stain poz 60-80 percent of patients and the antigen test is very sensitive + specific**
- TREAT: amphotericin + flucytosine 
- consolidation phase - fluconazole for 2 mon 

---
case 6
- 38 yo female first seizure ever no prior seizure, 
- just from guatemala 3 mon ago 
- ABC intact
- GCS 15 normal 
- tired , afebrile 
- CT scan -> we see 
1. cysticercosis - Taenia solium!!!
	1. disease is from **eating eggs shed by smeone who ate contaminated pork**
	2. in a orthodox jewish community everyone came down with this bc someone had a house keeper from latam who prepared food, so the eggs that were on her body went into the food and was eaten by them
	3. fecal-oral spread
	4. most common cause of global epilepsy 
2. in most common cause of seizures in some parts of the US 
3. we can see **subcutaneous + muscular cysts - small round painless firm nodules in like 25% of cases.. rarely into the heart causing conduction deficit s**
4. spinal cysticerosis - we can see **cystceri in subarachnoid space, cuasing inflam + demylinating changes in peripheral nerve roods**
5. or the eye

neurocysticercosis
- affecting actual brain parachyma
- most common form - 5 yrs after infection. 
- after the parasite dies, there's calcifications and intense inflammation in colloid stage -> seizures years down the road. 
- many cysts -> severe edema -> ICH + encephalitis 
- calcified state most common 
in colloidal stages - where the parasites not dead yet
- treat for infecctions - albendazoles, etc = anti-hemnthics
- **steroids to address that!! inflammation** - we need to address this first before killing the parasite and worsening inflammation 
if in that other stages, with parasite alraedy dead
- antiepileptics to prevent anything... **antiepileptics only in calcified state**

u can also have it inside the ventricular system and subarachnoid (can see vasculitis stuff) = don't have to know a lot about this 
- DX: CT = good for small calcified lesions
- better imagging with **mri in posterior fossa, near bone, and more sensitive to see deema + internal changes**
- recommend both once tested 

---
case 7 
- hiv + female with altered mental status 
- poor condition aparetment with cats 
1. toxoplasma gondii - with intermediat hosts like humans get oocyts from soil etc water undercooked meat or cats 
	1. anything contaminated by cat fesces
	2. congenital as torch infection 
	3. and can gt **reactivation in immunocompromised**
2. many ppl are infectd + then reactivate at later age
3. rarely symptomatic ... if acute it's flue like 
4. immunocompromised = **laten infection reactivates -> invovles brain, lungs, heart and eyes**
	1. cerebral toxoplasmosis - CD4 <50 , fever, ehadache, neuro deficits , AMS, coma 
in congenital toxoplasmosis triad:
- choriretinitis
- intracranial calcifications
- hydrocephalus. - not present immediately but they get eye delay and delay dvelopment
- CT = ring enhancing lesions
TREAT: = pyramethamine + sulphadiazne/clindamycin for 6 wks

case8 
- 48 yo male headache, rash + vsion change
- hx of idiopathic anterior uveitis of R eye 8 mon ago... then now with atraumatic painless L eye redness + vision loss, headache, rash 
1. bacterial infection = treponema pallidum - spirochete
	1. primary sypillis - 9=90 days after initial infection - chancre
		1. indurated painless punched out lesion 
		2. can be perinatal , 
		3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">give benzathine penicilin</mark>
	2. secondary - treponema count is highest - 
		1. 1-6 mo after nfection very maculopapular tansient andstuff
		2. low grade fever, malaise
		3. give benzathine penicilin
	3. late syphills
		1. gummas = gumma tissue destruction of skin, bones, liver, spleen 
		2. aortic aneurysms
		3. CNS dz - AMS, reflexes hyerpactive
		4. tabes dorsalis - peripheral neuropathy, ataxia 
		5. give IV penicillin every 4 hours for 2 weeks 

- neurosypiliis 
	- early is asymptomatic or mennigitis 
	- later = brain parenchyma of forget, prsonality changes, tremores, dysarthria
	- **argyl robertson pupil - this will accommodates or cross eyes to focus but pupil doesn't react!!!** 
	- spinal cord - posterior columsn + dorsal root = tabes dorsalis - we see ataxia, neuropathic pain + inability to tell body in space
	- DX: LP + CSF... know there's 
		- nontreponemal testing - test for antigens that aren't specific = **cardiolipid-choletsterol lecithin**
		- treponemal tests = testin for the bacteria itself
	- CSF: elevated lymphocytes - wBC , protein, CSF VDRL 
		- if neg, lymph > 5 cells and proteins are >45 mg/dL = diagnostic

case 9 - 32 yo mael w severe back pain 
- on arm - we see things that look like track mraks
- worsening, have been peeing ono self
- lumbar point tenderness
- decreased rectal tones + sensation between legs 
- <18 or >60... + cancer + immunodef + analgesa doesn't help 
- and cauda equina stuff: 
- hx of trauma 
1. this is **spinal epidural abscess!!!**
	1. consider with pt with back pain + fever + neuro 
	2. epidemiological RFS; immunosuppression, IVDU, recent back surg, infections hematogenousy spreadin
	3. DX: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">MRI</mark>
	4. and blood cultures + neurosurgery consult - 
	5. antibiotics - cover **MRSA, strep + gram- : vancomycin + ceftriaxone****


altered mental status = confusion, delerium, somnolence
