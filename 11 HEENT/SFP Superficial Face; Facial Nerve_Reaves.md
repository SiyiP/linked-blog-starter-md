forehead to chin and lower edge of mandible 
- face excludes the ears, very thin skin 

facial skeleton - 3 foramina - all vertical and straight line 
- supraorbtal 
- infraorbital
- mnental 

sensory -
- trigeminal nerve V1 - from the vertex to the nose 
	- has supraorbital N 
	- supratrochlear N 
	- infratrochlear ? 
	- external nasal? 
	- exits at **superior orbital fissure**
- V2 - maxillary , cheekbone to end of top lip 
	- infraorbital N , beneath orbit 
	- zygomaticotemporal ?
	- zygomaticofacial ? 
	- exits at **foramen rotundum**
- V3  - mandibular 
	- auriculotemporal n 
	- mental N 
	- buccal N , long and cutaneous! 
	- **exit foramen ovale**
trigeminal ganglion 
- in the middle cranial fossa  - each 3 divisions exit here. 
- next to the cavernous sinus 
- you'll see this huge nerve 


CN7 - facial expression - to move skin to communicate feelings and superficial sphincters + dilators of orifices. 
6 major muscles of facial expression , but we got 20+ 
1. frontalis 
2. orbicularis oculi around eye; has 3 parts; 
	1. palpebral - in eyelid, closing eyes during sleep 
	2. orbital - surrounding orbit, closing eye for protection from dust 
	3. lacrimal - fibers posterior to lacrimal gland bathes the eye 
		1. controlling tears - blinking spreads it, lacrimal gland is on the top lateral of eyelid, and then the canaliculi is on the side near the tear duct 
		2. loss of facial nerve = inability to close the eye, so we will see tears flowing onto the cheek with any loss 
		3. corneal reflex: a blink loop where both eyes blink and you tear up 
			1. sensory component = trigeminal 
			2. motor = facial nerve 
3. zygomaticus major 
	1. retracts/elevates the upper lip 
	2. dilator of mouth 
	3. this is a band of muscle from zygo cheekbone to the upper lip 
4. orbicularis oris - under the zygomaticus , under cheeckbone around mouth 
	1. closes mouth, controls foot bt front teeth, 
	2. kissing/whistling with puckering lips 
5. buccinator - deep muscle  - next to oral mucosa
	1. tone of cheek - keeping food in teeth + mucosa of cheek away from teeth 
	2. attached to **superior pharyngeal constrictor at pterygomandibular raphe**
	3. **pierced by parotid duct**
6. platysma 

function of CN 7 
somatic fibers - 2 types 
- somatic motor - facial expression 
- general visceral motor - glands with preganglioninc parasympathetic, lacrimal glands, submandibular glands, and sublingual glands 
special sensory fibers
- taste from anterio 2/3 of tongue (chordae tympani), and then to the exit is thru the **petrotympanic fissure
	- the lateral and medial wall of the ears:
	- lateral: chorda tympani is coming from into the **stylomastoid foaramen, exiting. facial canal ends at the stylomastoid foramen, as the chorda tympani n crossing tympanic membrane**
	- on the medial wall: 
	- **greater petrosal nerve a br of CN 7 ,, will enter via internal acoustic meatus , then the facial canal continues in posterior wall** 
	- will simply pass thru the geniculate ganglion 
- from the tongue's 2/3 -> carotid canal -> geniculate ganglion just passing thru -> chorda tympani -> to solitary nucleus of the upper medulla! 
general sensory - around the concha of the auricle + posterior auricular branch - this is around the ear 

**intrapetrous path** 
1. going thru the interna acoustic meatus WITH the vestibulocochlear CN8 
2. greater petrosal N will run pas thits 
3. passes laterally and anteriorly into the facial canal in petrous part of tempora bone **with the geniculate ganglion**
4. geniculate - a sharp bend here, and then **without synapsing, the facial nerve just passes thru this**
5. anteriorlly and laterall bt cochlea + semicircular canals 
posteriorly in facial canal = medial wall of the tympanic cavity 
inf in fcial canal - posterior tympanic cavity wall 
nerve to stapedius muscle = 
and then exits at the stylomastoid foramen 

extracranial course
 - main part of n exits the **stylomastoid foramen**
	 - stylohoid m 
	 - posterior belly of digastic
	 - lateral to retromandibular v 
	 - laterally + antriorlly thru parotid gland 
		 - **motor component of facial nerve bilaterally really travels inferior or just thru the parotid gland**
- chorda tympani exits at petrotympanic fissure - see infratemporal fossa here. 

main stem facial nerve brs while on the FACE. those provide the motor component 
- temporal - temprofacial division 
- zygomatic - temprofacial division 
- buccal - cervicofacial division 
- marginal mandibular - cervicofacial division 
- cervical - cervicofacial division 

2 parasympathetic pathways of CN7 
glands superior to oral cavity 
- greater petrosal n - from the CN7, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">passes thru the genicular ganglion</mark> and joins with the nerve of vidian, aka the<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> and will become the nerve of the pterygoid canal** </mark>which will synapse together at <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pterygopalatine</mark> ganglion
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	- and hitches a ride on V2 -> lacrimal n to the lacrimal gland</mark>
	- AND it will give sensory components to the nasal and palatine 
glands inf to oral cavity 
- CN 7 will innervate **chorda tympani, will synapse on submandibular ganglion** -> innervate sublingual + submandibular glands

major facial a - all bilateral 
- supraorbital - lateral 
- supratrochlear - medial! more curved in towards the nose
- superficial temporal 
	- from the external carotid a - the final br here 
	- **at superior margin of parotid gland**
- transverse facial - this is crossing to the cheek 
	- from the **external carotid - recall int carotid has nothng**
	- bt the zygomatic arch + parotid duct 
- infraorbital - travels in the 
	-  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	- br of maxillary a </mark>
- mental - in mental foramne 
	- br of inf alveolar a 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	- br of maxillary a </mark>
facial a - direct br from external carotid a - this is first to separate 
- anterior border of masseter m 
- facial a + transverse facial a will anastamose 
pulse points = aa crossing bones
- like the facial a at mandible 
- superficial temporal a at zygomatic arch 

![[superficial neck veins.png]]
- up top - the maxillary a juts out of the retromandibular 
- superficial temporal in that vertically jutting out straight part of retromandibular 
- retromandibular - behind the mandible near ear  

facial veins - 
- superior opthalamic vein- emerges at the superior orbitla fissure connects with the one in the inferior orbital fissure
- key ; **no valves + veins in the face <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">know there's no valves to shut it off bc the veins will spread infection fast - danger triangle thrombophlebitis of deep veins of head</mark>**

lymphatics of face
- key - pattern the blood supply - don't rlly see 
- but konw they have **names for areas**
- submental nodes - central low lip/chin 
- submandibular nodes - **anterior face**
- partid nodes - **lateral** face
- deep cervical nodes = **along int jugular v**

parotid gland - near the **zygomatic arch posterior end, anterior to mastoid, border o ramus mandible**
- facial nerve -**passes thru not innervating but branches will emerge under its anterior + superior portions be careful**

we have 2 parotid lobes
- superficial 
	- - most tumors are benignly and from here. 
- deep lobes
	- thi sis bt mastoid process + ramus of mandible 
in surgery careful due to CN7 


thru the gland is 
- facial n 
- retromandibular v + 2 tributaries
- ext carotid a + 2 terminal brs!!!
near it 
- masseter m - crosses this inf to transverse facial A , inf to the zygomatic arch  + turns medially @ anterior edge of masseter m 
- SCM m - 
- deep to it - medial pterygoid m , digastric m posterior , stylohyoid m 
- carotid sheath 
- this will **pierce buccinator m near anteiror border of masseter m**
the duct will open on buccal mucosa in vestibule of oral cavity - can feel the duct - the opening, lateral to upper 2nd molar!! - feel with yuor tongue!

parotid has: 
parasympathetic innervation via CN 9, the glossopharyngeal n - **lesser petrosal n**
1. inferior salivatory nucleus -> 
2. CN9 entering thru the jugular foramen 
3. -> tympanic br of CN 9 
4.  preganglionic parasympathetic fibers
5. tympanic plexus in the **middle ear!**
6. lesser petrosal N passes **thru the foramen ovale, which is where CNV3 also travels thru**
7. synapses on otic ganglion -> 
8. **hitches a ride on auriculotemporal n from CNV3 to rop those off!!!**
	1. note the middle meningeal A is surrounded by these! 
notes from [[SFP Introduction to Cranial Nerves Sympathetics, and Parasympathetics of Head and Neck_Hohn]] : 
 has parasymp fibers from the inferior salivatory nuc -> ganglia of the otic ganglia 
	- inferior salivatory nuc -> preganglionic parasympathetic fibers -> **lesser petrosal nerve** (br of glossopharyngeal n), which will convey **parasympathetic nerves** to the **otic ganglion in the infratemporal fossa** 
	- -> postganglionic parasympathetic ones travel thru **auriculotemporal nerve, which is CNV3** -> parotid gland 
		- note - the auriculotemporal n aka CNV3 will drop those parasympathetic nerves off as it ascends to supply the scalp 
		- runs with the auriculotemporal n = the **superficial temporal a



pathology 
1. pain distribution in CN V, usually V2. 
	1. more in women than men 
	2. pain in skin, teeth, tongue, mouth, nose 
	3. inc incidence with age, 
	4. MS , 
	5. TREAT: alc/glycerol injection thru foramen OVALE for injection into the ganglion 
	6. insertion of small balloon sometimes to stretch that semilunar ganglion = percutaneous rhizotomy 
2. if we get an injury at the lacrimal gland, near the N to stapedius
	1. injury right outside the internal acoustic meatus , -> dry eye loss of parasympathetic innervation to lacrimal glands
	2. hyperacusis - paralysis of stapedius muscle between the ganglion + stapedius bc inhibits the quality of sound 
	3. lesion at chorda tympani - loss of taste in 2/3rds of tongue + also **loss of submandibular + sublingual salivary glands**
	4. lesion right before exiting the stylomstoid foramen => paralysis of facial expression muscle 
![[facial nerve route and lesions.png]]
3. Bell's palsy - viral or inflammation -> swelling of nerve coverings
	1. you get one side of face paralyzed 
	2. this is due to impaired nerve conduction or injury due to restricted face
	3.  Treat - prednisone, coritcosteroids, antiinflammatory, most recover fully
