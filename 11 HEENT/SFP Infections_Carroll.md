#HEENT #patho 
case 
62 yo man - chronic alc, headache, stiff neck, swelling feet + abd + fever
lumbar buncture - many polymorphonuclear leukocytes, glucose + protein etc. 
l lower lobe infiltrate in cxray
- this pt has - strep pneumoniae - common in chronic alc 
- has leptomeningitis - common infiltrate of luncg -> brain 
- the microrg reached CNS via **seeding secondary to sepsis**

- entry thru defects in natural protective barriers
- spread from infections close to the brain like via otitis media
- hematogenous dissemination 
- pirating of retrograde axonal transport mechanisms 
- hiding in cel normally destined to enter into the cns like hiv encephalitis in teh macrophages 

special feat of cns infections
- we don't have a lot of room, edema can easily lead to hemorrhage 
- access to **subarachnoid space -> wide dispersal of organisms**
- BBB -initial barrier to inflammatory access, so gives microorganiisms a **window of opportunity to attack without the inflammatory cells fighting it**
- fibrosis is limited - **glial scars or gliosis does a bad job of encapsulating infections**

1. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">leptomeningitis</mark>. - inflam of pia and arachnoid which spread thru the CSF in **subarachnoid space**
	1. viruses - aseptic meningitis - acute and self limited, like a guy having a **headache with the flu!**  
	2. pyogenic bacteria - acute meningitis - can be deadly + very fasty progressing, headache -> go sleep and died
		1. pus on the surface of the brain when the body gets to respond. 
		2. we see pus into the sulci of the brain 
		3. and then the pus will be confined to subarachnoid space, across the entire surface of brain - little to keep it from spreading
	3. mycobacteria. + fungi - can be chronic + across a long time course 
- the bacteria will get into the brain too - due to the free communicating nature of subarachnoid space -> ventriculitis + choroid plexus 
- microscopically - large inflammatory cells + phagocytosed bacteria inside
- upon **lumbar puncture, CSF has inc pressure**
	- inc amt of white blood cells are inc, with much are polymorphonuclear leukocytes
	- glucose is low **compared to blood glucose** - **bc the bacteria are eating them all up** - u need both values!!
	- proteins are high - in part bc of the BBB breakdown 

long term sequele
- very irritating - extensive fibrosis in the **leptomeninges!! bc it's not the brain itself**
- will be **cut off blood supplie, causing small hemorrhage or strokes**
- or encapsulating the **arachnoid granulations, impeding CSF -> communicating hydrocephalus**
	- CSF will full contact to all part but then being blocked outside the brain, from getting out of there 
- pus in the ventricles can block the aqueduct of sylvius or the outflow foramina -> **noncommunicating hydrocephalus**
	- block inside ventricular system of brain, will see **dilutation o that narrow space without it dilating other parts**
- pus settles in base of brain too!!! -> this will encase cranial nerves + circle of willis -> fibrosis **around cranial nerves, CN palsies + deafness is common**
	- this fibrosis also entraps circle of willis + other smaller arteries -> vascular compromise, aka strokes happen 

1. tuberculous meningitis - subacute meningitis
	1. accumulation of granulations and granulomatous inflammatory infiltarte in basal leptomeninges 
	2. acid-fast bacilli inside multinucleated giant cells 
	3. similar to acute bacterial meninigitis 
2. cryptococcal meningitis. - happens a lot in immunocompromised, hiv 
	1. very pus-ish , glazed donut 
	2. basal ganglion - has **soap bubbles, makes a vircal robins spac,e making larger space opening up to those vessels**
	3. eventually get thru to the basal ganglion via those vessel connections 
3. long term leptomeningitis complications: hydrocephalus, seizures, sensorineural deafness, focal infarcs


abcesses - life cycle !!!! begins with cerebritis - which is a focal process of **localized suppurative destruction of brain tissue**
- this happens when bacteria or fungi -> infection of brain parenchyma via **direct spread from adjacent focus or hematogenous spread(now this is the most common) but in the past it's from infected middle ear**
- beakdown f the bbb + edema + blurring bt gray and white matter
	- many polymorphonuclear leukocytes 
	- indistinct borders
	- gliosis is just beignning - no evidence of fibrosis 
- over time... early -> late cerebritis 
	- change to **lymphocytes + macrophages!!!**
	- bc there's hypoxia, new BVs are secreted , visualized by a stain 
	- leaky -> edema worsens 
	- reticulin stain 
- mature abscess - **trilaminar structure**
	1. central liquefactive necrosis/acute inflammation 
	2. surrounded by a wall of granulation tissue with proliferating fibroblasts + capillaries 
	3. this is then surrounded by brain parenchyma with extensive gliosis 
	- these walls will be very tough!!! radiologically this **shows up as a ring-enhancing lesion....**
	- bc o the vascularity surrounding all the dead issues. 
- note - these. patients look much sicker than the avg person with glioblastoma in the early stages. 
- daughter abscess -formation in an early abscess 
	- there's not as well formed pus.... sometimes **rupture in wall of abscess will leak thru to make the daughter.**
	- but a rupture **into ventricles or subarachnoid space kills the patient**

many cortical abscesses caused by candda albicans hematogenously disseminated - happens in burn victims
- **note that this tends to seed into GRAY MATTER!!!! unliek all others which seed into gray-white junction**

aspergillus - abscesses would **mimick hemorrhagic infarcts**
- bc they're larger organisms they will break off while they get to the brain via hematogenous dissemination 
- lodges into mid-size arteries + invades arterial wall -> **arterial rupture**
- this is hemorrhage. looks like infarc.... 
- hard to get rid of, ppl think they got a hemorrhagic stroke 

mucormycosis abscess - most often fungal infection seen in diabetics
- invasion thru cribiform plate of nose -> underbelly of **frontal** brain lobe 
- localized abscess in brain tissue 
- keep coming back hard to rid of ): 

toxoplasma cerebritis - from toxoplasma gondii from cat feces with oocysts
- most ppl have them 
- can make systemic dz looking like infectious mononucleosis with fever + **maculopapular rash**
- this CNS infection - **opportunistic + happens in severely immunocompromised patients**
- grossly like multifocal cerebritis + abscesses - acute necrotizing, organizing + chronic forms 
- microscopically - **encephalitic pattern in some ppl with minimal perivasc inflammation + nodules with scattered free tachyzoites**
- in cerebirits/abscess formation - necrosis of brain parenchyma with many tachyzoites + bradyzoite pseudocysts 
- congenital toxo is very destructive - with extensive dysrtrophic stufff 

encephalitis - localized or diffuse inflammation of brain + overlying leptomeninges
3 forms 
1. acute viral encephalitis 
	1. perivascular lymphocytic cuff in acute viral encephalitis 
	2. microglial nodule in acute cviral encephalitis 
	3. dying neuron is being chewed up by microglia - neuronophagia 
	4. no viral inclusions 
	5. herpes encephalitis - happens in ppl without obvious immunosuppression
		1. undersurface of temporal and less commonly frontal lobe! 
		2. very destructive and hemorrhagic 
		3. patchy contrast enhancement 
		4. hematoxylin and eosin section of temporal lobe.... we will see prominent eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion. 
		5. psyciatric disorders ): 
	6. rabies inclusions 
		1. negri bodies - 
		2. rabies has.a predilection for neurons in brainstem + purkinje cells of cerebellum 
		3. involvement of **brainstem nuclei make it hard for patients to swallow**
		4. transmitted from bite or inhalation from infected bat guano - splunkers get pulmonary form of it 
	7. hemorrhagic lesions of ventral horn in polio 
		1. initially polio is GI 
	8. multinucleate giant cell in HIV encephalitis - clinically evident as a **dementia**
		1. the multinucleate giant cells are from macrophages fusing and widespread microglial noduels occurence 
2. acute postinfectious - like from pasteur's rabies virus 
3. subacute encephalitis - HIV
