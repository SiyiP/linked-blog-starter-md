#HEENT 

lumbar cord
- anterior spinal cord - posterior to last radicular artery - an injury to this 
	- huge injury to 2/3rds of spine, bilateral paralysis caudal to block, to legs
	- bilateral loss of pain + temp 
	- bladder issues

cervical 
- br from ASA at C5
- ipsilateral paralysis, a bit to the side now 
	- upper motor neuron below the C5 
	- lower motor neuron at C5 
- contralateral loss of pain + temp below C5 

spinomedullary junction - with brainstem syndromes
- low in the brainstem, 
- penetrating lateral brs from the vertebral a 
- loss of pain + temp in ipsilateral face and contralateral body 
- dysphagia hoarseness , and ipsilateral horner's syndrome 
- ipsilateral unsteadiness 
	- AKA **lateral medullary syndrome - WALLENBURG: can be caused by the PICA, a br off the vertebral artery**

open medulla
- penetrating brs from ASA
- ipsilateral tongue dviation 
- contralateral loss of touch + position + paresis 
- **aka MEDIAL medullary syndrome with the tongue deviation!** higher up the brainstem, 3,4,5, etc. 
- low bc of tongue invovement 

ventral pons
- basilar occlusion -> **locked in syndrome - only have vertical eye movements**
- mimics brain dead patients. no motor movements due to dmg to corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts (facial movements)
- but still conscious with vertebral eye movement in midbrain intact 
- once you have dmg it's there forev ): 

caudal pons - 
- penetrator from anterior inff cerebellar artery 
- loss of pain + temp in contralateral body + ipsilateral aface
- ipsilateral loss of facial strength + decreased hearing 
- aka **lateral pontine syndrome. we got some facial invovement now**

mid pons - 
- long circumferential from basillar artery 
- contralat loss of pain, temp, touch, position, sense from everything. 
- ipsilateral paralysis of **jaw muscle + dec contralateral auditory perceptiion**

rostral midbrain - higher up 
- medial penetrating br from basilar artery 
- contralat paralysis of face + body 
- **ipsilateral CN3 palsy**
- contralateral ataxia 
- **claude syndrome = impacts the red nucleus**
	- because of the **contralateral ataxia**

midbrain syndromes(in the same area, but how much dmg is there?): 
- benedikt - ipsilateral CN3 palsy, contralateral weakness, tremor, ataxia = **dmg to red nuc + superior cerebellar peduncle** - a bit of both 
- weber's -  ipsilateral CN3 palsy, , and **contralateral hemiparesis - superior cerebellar peduncle; weakness**

posteroir forebrain 
- dmg to the **PCAs** - dmg to the thalamus, which 
- involves contralateral loss of touch, proprioception, pain and temp from body + face!!!
- any dmg to the one artery which supplies both thalamus = we get consciousness lost 

internal capsule arterial supply 
- anterior limb 
	- upper -> lenticulostriate from MCA
	- lower -> recurrent artery of huebner from ACA
- genu 
	- upper -> leenticulostriate from MCA 
	- lower -> lenticulostriate from **ICA**
- posterior limb 
	- upper -> lenticulostriate from MCA
	- lower = **anterior choroidal artery from ICA**

occlusion 
of ACA
- contralateral paralysis of legs , frontal lobe behavioral issues. 
of PCA 
- **vision, eyes, sensory**
MCA:
- L and R
- contralateral paralysis of arms, and sensory loss there too 
- L = language ; 
	- - wernicke's aphasia- trouble understanding but can talk pretty well. this is the **inferior division of the left MCA**
	-  brocas - can't make speech = this is more frontal ; much better, can still understand. 
- R = neglect ;
