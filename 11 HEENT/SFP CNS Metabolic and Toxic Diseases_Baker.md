alcohol related syndromes
1. wernicke encephalopathy - acute B1 thiamine def 
	1. triad - altered mental, oculomotor dysfunction, cerebellar signs 
	2. replace thiamine (cofactor for glucose metabolism); can reverse the symptoms 
	3. from GI surgical procedures , vomiting/chronic diarrhea, systemiic dz like AIDs, etc
	4. gross changes - we see **hemorrhagic mamillary bodies in wenicke's!!!!**; a punctate dark hemorrhage discoloration to it 
	5. on imaging, we can see **hyperintense mammillary bodies!!! - white color **
	6. wenicke's - we see **vascular congestion, edema, inset small hemorrhages, gliosis**
		1. gliosis = analogus to fibrosis in the body a scar in the brain
2. korsakoff syndrome. - chronic 
	1. 2/2 prolonged def, 
	2. anterograde amnesia + confabulation ; insert things that didn't happen in the story 
	3. **irreversible ):**
	4. gross change - shrunken, yellow-brown mamillary bodies... and **dilated 3rd ventricles with 2/2 loss of brain tissue**; neurons die, and you get reactive gliosis and byproduct of that ... hemosiderin is seen 
	5. on imaging... we see atrophic mamillary bodies + **atrophic cerebellum too**
	6. 4th ventricles - **punctate hemorrhages around this too**
	7. around the cerebral aqueduct or periaqueductal region - is hemorrhaged too 
	8. microscopically - **a lot of white space in the slide, rarefaction loss of brain substance, a cavitation** + macrophages + hemosiderin maybe 
3. cerebellar degeneration - truncal ataxia, no coordination of **lower limbs**
	1. can happen with wernicke korsakoff
	2. **atrophy of anterior vermis lobe** - more space between superior and anterior lobes. the **atrophy = whitened spaces between folia** 
	3. 3 layers - the molecular layer, purkinje cell layer and internal granule cell layer
		1. purkinje cell losses and then the smaller internal granule cell layer loss => folia spaces widn 
4. osmotic demyelination syndrome - central pontine myelinolysis 
	1. classically due to rapid reversal of **hyponatremia in alc use
	2. pons most often impacted
	3. caused by dysosmolar state, the quick correction of sodium -> this pproblem... and in other situations too 
	4. can cause **hyperosmlar states like severe burns!!!**
	5. basically it all demyelinates and idk why . mild / asymptomatic to totally fatal, degrees of paralysis or altered consciousness
	6. white matter = looks very white running thru the pons 
	7. we see a **bat shaped dark triangular shadow on the pons, indicatioon of lack of myelination**
	8. ![[Screenshot 2025-11-03 at 10.26.40 PM.png]]
5. polyneuropathy can be caused by this too 
6. b12 def = subacute combined degeneration 
	1. only this will cause cns issues
	2. malaborsption of cobalamin due to either stomach or term ileum issues where IF release and B12 absorption is jacked up 
	3. symmetrical prog lower extremity paresthesias. +weakness which begins distal -> proximal 
	4. not sure why spinal cord degen but there is... **spasticity loss of postural sensation (unsteady gait)**, and spastic paraplegia, contractures, ataxia 
	5. the white matter of the SC will be degenerated - **usually involving the posterior sensory and lateral motor columns .... **
		1. early demyelination with later axon loss + gliosis 
	6. not rlly demyelination process, but demyelination is secondary to this degeneration 

neuropath with acquired metabolic dz 
1. diabetic hypoglycemic encephalopathy
	1. insulin od!!!
	2. neurons need constant glucose 
	3. too much exogenous insulin - OD 
	4. as little as 1-2 hrs **without glucose = brain dmg !!!**
	5. neuronal degeneration selective... most are most sensitivty and die first 
		1. most vulnerable - pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex layers 3,5,6!!! -> laminar necrosis 
		2. dentate nucleus of infant 
		3. in adults - pyramidal neurons CA1 - sommer's sector of hippocampus 
			1. this is liek the jelly roll of hippocampus gyrus 
			2. in chronic injury we see a cavity where it is, with the absence in the CA1 region. 
	6. acute hypoglycemic brain injury - wswelling + discoloration + see hypereosinophilic neurons -<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> dead red neurons</mark> in the dentate nucleus... <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">no nucleus seen  and cytoplasmic blueness lost too... </mark>
	7. chronic hypoglycemic brain injury - **laminar necrosis - see cavity holes basically.... with the hole where they lost thru rarefaction. + associated gliosis** - end up with the inc **white** space
	8. any gliosis - pink cytoplasm + spider like processes = the astrocytes ! 
2. acquired metabolic encephalopathy - liver dz 
	1. 2/2 severe liver dz. = related to **inc ammonia levels**
	2. completely variable depending on duration + acute v chronic 
	3. typical - cog impairment, confusion drowsiness -> coma, asterixis, 
	4. acute onset can be rapidly fatal 
	5. chronic / repeated episodes cause neuropsych disturbance, ataxia, dysarthria 
	6. alz type 2 cells or astrocytes!!! these will take on the ammonia and then take in too much water too after converting the ammonia. **water makes these white spots; not caused dementia, just named after same person**
	7. ![[Screenshot 2025-11-03 at 10.36.43 PM.png]] 
3. Reye syndrome - not as common nowadays  - this caused by aspirin 
	1. core - will disrupt the mitochonrial function, causing fatty accumulation in liver and cytotoxicity edema in the brain.
		1. when brain diffusely swells -> infarctions 
	2. hepatic encephalopathy usually 
	3. postviral usually 
4. wilson dz - **aka hepatolenticular degeneration**
	1. AR mutatioon in chromosome 13 - putative copper transport ATPase, deficient ceruloplasmiin, elevated serum copper 
	2. copper accumulates where it shouldn't - kayser-fleischer rings 
	3. hepatic failure/cirrhosis (nodular and pale)
	4. dementia sytmpoms + extrapyramidal signs liek tremor, rigidity, etc 
	5. cavitation + brownish/brick red discoloration in the **putamen**
	6. adolescent onset 
	7. **alzheimers type 2 astrocytes!!!!**  as well 

5. CO poisoning 
	1. CO binds hgb more strongly than o2, so o2 not delvered 
	2. nonspecific symptoms, nausea, abd pain, fatigue, altered mental, seizures 
	3. chronic/survivors = cog/neuropsych/mood instability, dystonia, parkinsonium, chorea ; perm brain dmg
	4. co loves **globus pallidus - cavitation of this and necrosis, bilateral hemorrhagic infarction**
	5. demyelination too - patches of myelin loss in white matter
6. methanol - moonshine contaminant 
	1. can go blind - retinal + optic nerve dmg 
	2. hemorrhagic leukoencephalopathy - focal white matter necrosis 
	3. bilateral putamen necrosis 
7. iatrogenic harm to NS 
	1. radiation therapy - causes coagulative necrosis, fibrotic/hyalined vessel walls in bvs, reactive gliosis 
		1. 2ndary tumors too like meningiomas, sarcomas, high grade gliomas 
	2. chemotherapy / methotrexate neurotoxicity - can end up with **white matter dmg multifocal necrotizing leukoencephalopathy**
		1. red and yellow spots and stuff
	3. lead toxicity - inorg lead + heavy metals
		1. adults occupational = **hypochrmic microcytic anemia, lead colic, peripheral, neuropathy, gingival lead line**
		2. kids = **dev delay, cerebral edema, perm delays, hypchromic microcytic anemia, epiphyseal lead line** gingival lead lines
