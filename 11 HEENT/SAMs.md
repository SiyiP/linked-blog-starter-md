about the corneal / blink reflex
Light touch to the cornea elicits a closing of the eye (blink) as a mechanism to protect the cornea from damage. 
The sensory component of this corneal reflex is the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic division of CN V. 
The **motor component is carried by the facial nerve**, through its temporal and zygomatic branches, which carry motor fibers to the orbicularis oculi muscle.

| Parasympathetic fibers conveyed by CN VII destined for the lacrimal gland pass between the brainstem and the geniculate ganglion. From the geniculate ganglion, these preganglionic parasympathetic fibers pass through the greater petrosal nerve toward the pterygopalatine ganglion. (See Netter Plate 150, 8e) |     |
CN III innervates: 

Levator palpebrae superioris - ptosis 

Superior, inferior, medial rectus - eye position

Inferior oblique - upward movement 

Parasympathetic fibers to sphincter pupillae - pupillary constriction

Ciliary muscle - accommodation

Lesion causes ptosis, "down and out" eye (due to unopposed actions of lateral rectus and superior oblique mm.), mydriasis, loss of light and accommodation reflexes

Pupil dilation = sympathetic function 

Pupil constriction = parasympathetic function (via Edinger-Westphal nucleus --> CN III ---> ciliary ganglion)

All sympathetic innervation to structures in the head originate from postganglionic neurons located in the superior cervical symp ganglion 

**short ciliary nerves** convey postganglionic parasympathetic fibers that provide parasympathetic innervation to the ciliary muscle and the sphincter pupillae muscle of the eye. Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers are carried by CN III to the ciliary ganglion, where they synapse. 

Chorda tympani (br. of CN VII) conveys preganglionic parasympathetic fibers destined for the submandibular ganglion.  Recall this nerve joins the lingual nerve (CN V3) in the infratemporal fossa, which then conveys those preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from CN VII to the submandibular ganglion.

The lesser petrosal nerve (br. of CN IX) conveys preganglionic fibers to the otic ganglion. The fibers synapse in the otic ganglion and are conveyed to the parotid gland by the auriculotemporal nerve (CN V3).

The deep petrosal nerve carries postganglionic sympathetic fibers, which synapsed in the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk, through the pterygopalatine ganglion.

The **greater petrosal nerve (br. of CN VII)** conveys preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the pterygopalatine ganglion. Prior to reaching the ganglion, the greater petrosal nerve is joined by the deep petrosal nerve, which carries postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion. 
Note that these two nerves greater + deep petrosal join to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal (Vidian n.) which is a mixed nerve, conveying both preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from CN VII and postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion to the pterygopalatine ganglion within the pterygopalatine fossa.

| The superior salivatory nucleus (CN VII) gives rise to fibers that travel with the chorda tympani to the submandibular ganglion (via the lingual nerve) to stimulate secretion from the submandibular and sublingual glands. |     |

which CNs pass thru which parts???
  
Olfactory nerves (CN I) pass through cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone.

Oculomotor nerve (CN III) passes through the superior orbital fissure.

Maxillary nerve (CN V3) passes through foramen rotundum. 

Facial nerve (CN VII) passes through the stylomastoid foramen.

Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) passes through the jugular foramen.

A 21-year-old man with a history of intellectual disability and seizures most of his life undergoes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of his brain. The MRI shows multiple sites where the cerebral cortical ribbon is thickened and not clearly demarcated from the underlying white matter. This scan also shows nodules protruding into his lateral ventricles. What is this patient at increased risk for the developing?
-  patient has tuberous sclerosis, with<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> hamartomas in the cortical ribbon and ventricles (subependymal nodules)</mark>, also referred to as **'tubers' and 'candle gutterings,'** respectively. CNS manifestations in patients are most commonly<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> seizures and intellectual disability</mark>. 
- The subependymal nodules are at risk for progressing to a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma.

WHO Grade I meningiomas can invade bone and soft tissue/scalp but do NOT invade the brain parenchyma. In the less common higher grade meningiomas, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">brain invasion is typical. </mark>Other characteristics of the Grade 1 meningiomas include **hyperostosis** of the overlying skull, calcification of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">psammoma bodies</mark>, and the development of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">edema</mark> in the adjacent brain.

Negri bodies are pathognomonic, eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions found in neurons (especially in the hippocampus, brainstem and cerebellum) of those infected with the rabies virus. They are viral ribonuclear proteins.

Perivascular lymphocytic cuffing, microglial nodules, and neuronophagia may all be seen with viral encephalitis but lymphocytic cuffing is the most pathognomonic.

rolonged hypotension likely resulted in hypoxic conditions. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Cortical neurons in laminae III and V are sensitive to hypoxia</mark>, and the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">neuronal death results in laminar necrosis</mark>. Other areas sensitive to hypoxia include Sommer's sector (hippocampus) and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum.

Ependymomas are WHO grade II tumors that typically occur in **children and young adults.** They arise from ependymal cells, thus on the walls of the ventricles or the spinal cord central canal and often present secondary to obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid.

Lacunar infarcts are small, often clinically silent, 'strokes' usually caused by<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> hypertension and are most often seen in the basal ganglia, thalamus, internal capsule and brainstem</mark>. Grossly, they appear small, well-circumscribed lesions that eventually become cavitated.

 Leukodystrophies are a group of rare inherited neurological disorders that affect the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. There is abnormal production, processing, or development of myelin, leading to a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">progressive loss of neurological function and variable, progressive problems with movement, balance, coordination, speech, vision, and cognitive abilities.</mark>

A 58-year-old patient receives a heart transplant and subsequently displays progressive dementia, ataxia, visual field defects, and spasticity.  Scans show many small areas of change in white matter.  Biopsy shows many large bizarre astrocytes, macrophages,  enlarged oligodendroglia with nuclear inclusions and loss of myelin.  What is the most likely diagnosis?
-  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> infectious demyelinating disease which complicates an underlying condition such as a lymphoproliferative disorder or immunocompromised stat</mark>e (status post heart transplant in this case). Histology shows large numbers of macrophages and bizarre oligodendrocytes with enlarged <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"plum-colored" nuclei </mark>packed with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">JC</mark> virus.

|CNS INFECTIONS - On MRI, cerebral abscess typically appears as a ring-enhancing lesion due to its well defined capsule and necrotic center. There is often surrounding vasogenic edema.|   |

An alcoholic man living on the streets comes to the emergency department complaining of low-grade fever, malaise, headache and anorexia.  He has a<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> cough and a cavitary lesion</mark> on <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">chest</mark> x-ray.  A CT scan shows hydrocephalus. The cerebrospinal fluid shows increased pressure, protein, and mononuclear cells, and decreased glucose.  A meningeal biopsy would most likely show:
- think of tb = CNS INFECTIONS - Between the patient's pulmonary cavitary lesion and the CSF analysis suggesting a viral or intracellular process, tuberculosis is high on the differential. Tuberculous meningitis tends to produce a subacute meningitis with sequalae similar to that of acute bacterial meningitis. Its inflammatory pattern is the same as in other areas of the body (caseous granulomas).

By definition, medulloblastomas arise in the cerebellum and thus commonly cause obstructive hydrocephalus when extending into the 4th ventricle. These are high grade tumors (WHO IV) occurring primarily in children. A small percentage are associated with genetic syndromes: Type 2 Turcot's syndrome, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

| Opening the auditory tube during swallowing and yawning is achieved by the tensor veli palatini (CN V3) and the salpingopharyngeus (CN X) muscles. |     |
Tensor veli palatini m. – tenses the soft palate, which allows other muscles attached to the palate to work more effectively, and opens the auditory tube during swallowing/yawning

Salpingopharyngeus m. – assists with propelling food bolus downward; acts to open the pharyngeal opening of the auditory tube to equalize pressure between middle ear and pharynx during swallowing

Middle pharyngeal constrictor m. – contracts to propel food bolus downward

Stylopharyngeus m. – elevates pharynx and larynx during swallowing to allow for passage of large food bolus

| The external laryngeal nerve (external br. of the superior laryngeal nerve) innervates the **cricothyroid muscle, which tenses the vocal ligaments to raise** pitch.  Damage to this nerve results in a monotone voice and inability to produce high-pitched sounds. |     |
The **oblique arytenoid muscle**, along with the aryepiglottic part of the oblique arytenoid and transverse arytenoid muscles, helps to close the laryngeal inlet during swallowing, preventing aspiration.

Posterior cricoarytenoid – abducts vocal ligaments

Cricothyroid – lengthens and tenses vocal ligaments (higher pitch)

Thyroarytenoid/vocalis –  relaxes, shortens/widens vocal ligaments (deeper pitch)

The posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nn., abduct the vocal folds (ligaments) to open the airway. 

Bilateral paralysis would cause restricted respiration and aphonia (loss of ability to speak).
