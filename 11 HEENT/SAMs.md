need to know: 

- In the Weber test, sound lateralizes to the affected ear in conductive hearing loss and to the unaffected ear in sensorineural hearing loss.
- If sound is louder in the left ear, it suggests conductive hearing loss in the left ear or sensorineural loss in the right ear.
- Since conductive loss enhances bone conduction, the sound is perceived louder in the affected ear.

- Otitis externa (also known as "swimmer's ear") is an infection of the external auditory canal, often caused by bacteria (e.g., _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, _Staphylococcus aureus_).
- Key features include pain with manipulation of the pinna or tragus, itching, canal swelling, and sometimes discharge.
- Necrotizing otitis externa is a severe, invasive infection often seen in elderly diabetic or immunocompromised patients. It is typically caused by _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and can progress to skull base osteomyelitis.
- Key distinguishing features include:
    - Granulation tissue at the bone-cartilage junction of the external canal
    - Facial nerve palsy or other cranial nerve involvement
    - Severe, deep otalgia, often worse at night
- Typical otitis externa presents with canal erythema, itching, and pain with pinna manipulation, but does not involve deeper structures or cranial nerves.

- Acute otitis media commonly occurs in children due to Eustachian tube dysfunction, which impairs ventilation and drainage of the middle ear.
- This leads to negative pressure, fluid accumulation, and creates an environment conducive to bacterial growth (e.g., _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _Haemophilus influenzae_).
- Children are more susceptible due to their shorter, more horizontal Eustachian tubes.

- **Streptococcus pneumoniae** is the most frequent cause of AOM, especially in younger children.
- Haemophilus influenzae (nontypeable) and Moraxella catarrhalis are also common, particularly in cases associated with otitis-conjunctivitis syndrome.
- Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are less common and more often associated with chronic or complicated ear infections like otitis externa or necrotizing otitis externa.

- Stapedectomy is the surgical treatment of choice for otosclerosis, involving removal of the fixed stapes and replacement with a prosthesis to restore sound conduction.
- Hearing aids may be considered for patients who are not surgical candidates or prefer non-invasive options.
- Corticosteroids, antibiotics, and myringotomy are not effective for otosclerosis, as it is a bone remodeling disorder, not an infectious or inflammatory condition.
- Mastoidectomy is used for chronic infections or cholesteatoma, not otosclerosis.

- Presbycusis is the most common cause of hearing loss in older adults and is due to age-related degeneration of cochlear hair cells, especially those responsible for high-frequency sound detection.
- The basal turn of the cochlea processes high-frequency sounds, which are typically affected first.
- It results in sensorineural hearing loss, often symmetrical and progressive.

-   
    Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is defined as a rapid loss of hearing (≥30 dB over at least three contiguous frequencies) occurring over less than 72 hours.
- The exact cause is often idiopathic, but proposed mechanisms include viral infection, vascular compromise, or autoimmune inner ear disease.
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">- High-dose corticosteroids (oral or intratympanic) are the first-line treatment to reduce inflammation and improve recovery chances.</mark>
	- 

- The gradual, progressive unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and imbalance are classic for vestibular schwannoma.

- Vestibular neuritis is characterized by acute onset of vertigo <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">without hearing loss or tinnitus, due to inflammation of the vestibular nerve.</mark>
- Meniere's disease involves episodic <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">vertigo, unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness, caused by endolymphatic hydrops.</mark>
- A **positive head impulse test** supports vestibular neuritis.
- Hearing loss is a key differentiator, present in Meniere's but absent in vestibular neuritis.

- SSCDS occurs when the bone overlying the superior semicircular canal is thinned or absent, creating a third mobile window in the inner ear.
- This leads to vestibular symptoms (e.g., vertigo with sound or pressure changes) and auditory symptoms (e.g., autophony, conductive hearing loss). = whooshing 
- It is diagnosed with high-resolution CT and vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs).

about the corneal / blink reflex
Light touch to the cornea elicits a closing of the eye (blink) as a mechanism to protect the cornea from damage. 
The sensory component of this corneal reflex is the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic division of CN V. 
The **motor component is carried by the facial nerve**, through its temporal and zygomatic branches, which carry motor fibers to the orbicularis oculi muscle.

| Parasympathetic fibers conveyed by CN VII destined for the lacrimal gland pass between the brainstem and the geniculate ganglion. From the geniculate ganglion, these preganglionic parasympathetic fibers pass through the greater petrosal nerve toward the pterygopalatine ganglion. (See Netter Plate 150, 8e) |     |
CN III innervates: 

Levator palpebrae superioris - ptosis 

Superior, inferior, medial rectus - eye position

Inferior oblique - upward movement 

Parasympathetic fibers to sphincter pupillae - pupillary constriction

Ciliary muscle - accommodation

Lesion causes ptosis, "down and out" eye (due to unopposed actions of lateral rectus and superior oblique mm.), mydriasis, loss of light and accommodation reflexes

Pupil dilation = sympathetic function 

Pupil constriction = parasympathetic function (via Edinger-Westphal nucleus --> CN III ---> ciliary ganglion)

All sympathetic innervation to structures in the head originate from postganglionic neurons located in the superior cervical symp ganglion 

**short ciliary nerves** convey postganglionic parasympathetic fibers that provide parasympathetic innervation to the ciliary muscle and the sphincter pupillae muscle of the eye. Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers are carried by CN III to the ciliary ganglion, where they synapse. 

Chorda tympani (br. of CN VII) conveys preganglionic parasympathetic fibers destined for the submandibular ganglion.  Recall this nerve joins the lingual nerve (CN V3) in the infratemporal fossa, which then conveys those preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from CN VII to the submandibular ganglion.

The lesser petrosal nerve (br. of CN IX) conveys preganglionic fibers to the otic ganglion. The fibers synapse in the otic ganglion and are conveyed to the parotid gland by the auriculotemporal nerve (CN V3).

The deep petrosal nerve carries postganglionic sympathetic fibers, which synapsed in the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk, through the pterygopalatine ganglion.

The **greater petrosal nerve (br. of CN VII)** conveys preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the pterygopalatine ganglion. Prior to reaching the ganglion, the greater petrosal nerve is joined by the deep petrosal nerve, which carries postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion. 
Note that these two nerves greater + deep petrosal join to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal (Vidian n.) which is a mixed nerve, conveying both preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from CN VII and postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion to the pterygopalatine ganglion within the pterygopalatine fossa.

A 58-year-old patient receives a heart transplant and subsequently displays progressive dementia, ataxia, visual field defects, and spasticity.  Scans show many small areas of change in white matter.  Biopsy shows many large bizarre astrocytes, macrophages,  enlarged oligodendroglia with nuclear inclusions and loss of myelin.  What is the most likely diagnosis?

|CNS INFECTIONS - On MRI, cerebral abscess typically appears as a ring-enhancing lesion due to its well defined capsule and necrotic center. There is often surrounding vasogenic edema.|   |

An alcoholic man living on the streets comes to the emergency department complaining of low-grade fever, malaise, headache and anorexia.  He has a<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> cough and a cavitary lesion</mark> on <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">chest</mark> x-ray.  A CT scan shows hydrocephalus. The cerebrospinal fluid shows increased pressure, protein, and mononuclear cells, and decreased glucose.  A meningeal biopsy would most likely show:
- think of tb = CNS INFECTIONS - Between the patient's pulmonary cavitary lesion and the CSF analysis suggesting a viral or intracellular process, tuberculosis is high on the differential. Tuberculous meningitis tends to produce a subacute meningitis with sequalae similar to that of acute bacterial meningitis. Its inflammatory pattern is the same as in other areas of the body (caseous granulomas).

By definition, medulloblastomas arise in the cerebellum and thus commonly cause obstructive hydrocephalus when extending into the 4th ventricle. These are high grade tumors (WHO IV) occurring primarily in children. A small percentage are associated with genetic syndromes: Type 2 Turcot's syndrome, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

| Opening the auditory tube during swallowing and yawning is achieved by the tensor veli palatini (CN V3) and the salpingopharyngeus (CN X) muscles. |     |
Tensor veli palatini m. – tenses the soft palate, which allows other muscles attached to the palate to work more effectively, and opens the auditory tube during swallowing/yawning

Salpingopharyngeus m. – assists with propelling food bolus downward; acts to open the pharyngeal opening of the auditory tube to equalize pressure between middle ear and pharynx during swallowing

Middle pharyngeal constrictor m. – contracts to propel food bolus downward

Stylopharyngeus m. – elevates pharynx and larynx during swallowing to allow for passage of large food bolus

| Cricothyrotomy is performed through the median cricothyroid membrane (ligament), located between the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage. This provides rapid airway access while avoiding major blood vessels. |     |

| The external laryngeal nerve (external br. of the superior laryngeal nerve) innervates the **cricothyroid muscle, which tenses the vocal ligaments to raise** pitch.  Damage to this nerve results in a monotone voice and inability to produce high-pitched sounds. |     |
The **oblique arytenoid muscle**, along with the aryepiglottic part of the oblique arytenoid and transverse arytenoid muscles, helps to close the laryngeal inlet during swallowing, preventing aspiration.

Posterior cricoarytenoid – abducts vocal ligaments

Cricothyroid – lengthens and tenses vocal ligaments (higher pitch)

Thyroarytenoid/vocalis –  relaxes, shortens/widens vocal ligaments (deeper pitch)

The posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nn., abduct the vocal folds (ligaments) to open the airway. 

Bilateral paralysis would cause restricted respiration and aphonia (loss of ability to speak).
