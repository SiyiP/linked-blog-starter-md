1. Identify the structural components of the lip and oral mucosa. 
2. Differentiate between the olfactory mucosa and nasal mucosa.  
3. Identify the 3 main cell layers of the olfactory epithelium and the following components in the  
lamina propria: Bowman's glands; dilated venules; axon bundles of the olfactory nerve.  
4. Differentiate between mucosa of the nasopharynx and mucosa of the oropharynx.  
5. Identify the epithelium, types of papillae, glands, and musculature of the tongue.  
6. Differentiate between the lingual, pharyngeal, and palatine tonsils.  
7. Identify components in the false (vestibular) folds and true (vocal) folds in the larynx.
about like 7 slides to access and look into 

germinal centers? of the tonsil region what's th native antigen there? 
- follicular dendrtic cells
- macrophages - clean up the cells
- dendritic cells - present antigen - not hihgly in follicules 
- reticular cells - yes they're in htere, the nodules need support to interact w/ each other

remember: germinal center rxn 
- naive B cell -> germinal center migration post-activation by helper T cells 
- - Ag+ T-cell help induce AID and migration to germinal center
- massive expansion of B cell + hypermutation Ig variable
- follicular dendritic present native antigen 
- then only w/ high affinity = those b cells survive 

L selectin - leukocyte surface
e-selectin = on the endothelial surface for slow rolling 
HEV in lymphoid organs express ICAM1 and CD34 + 

compare and contrast:
- size of crypts, 
- number crypts/tonsil 
- epithelium 
- capsule 
in the 3 tonsils = **palatine, pharyngeal, lingual**

palatine 

pharyngeal 

lingual tonsils of the 1/3 dorsum of tongue 

recurrent laryngeal n - motor innervation. =to the all other intrinsic larynx muscles - run in the TE groove entering laryx p
cricothyroid muscle motor= external laryngeal n !! of superior laryngeal n - br off vagus 
interna
all while internal laryngeal sensory innervation to above the vocal fold of the larynx - mucosal above the vocal old - will pierce thyrohyoid cmembrane 

![[muscls acting on arytenoids.png]]
posterior cricoarytenoid = is the only intrinsic muscle which abducts the true vocal folds 
and recall: thyroaarytenoid will instead shorten the thyroid cartilage, changing the pitch 


---
bowmans glands will secrete mucus in the nasal cavity - recall 

taste otherwise in the tongue = chorda tympani = jumps onto the **facial nerve when going back to the CNS**
the **circumvellate papillae = on the 1/3 POSTERIOR of tongue!!!**
- so it'll be innervated by the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">glossopharyngeal nerve, as the exception to the special sensation of the taste</mark>
- vagus n provides 


hypoglossal = in the motor of the tongue ... 
- coming in from under the tongue 

----
miinor seromucous glands = on the oral mucosa - the salivary glands


lingual n -> laterally approaches the tongue from infratemporal fossa 

---
facial nerve => goes thru stylomastoid foramen 
- plasma cells -> give out secretory IgA in the oral cavity esp as stroma of the salivary glands 

antigens inside the crypts of the tonsils 
- M cells? 
- they overlie **the lymphoid tissues all in the digestive system**
- stratified squamoud epithelium lining tonsilllar crypts have modded reticulations.... allowing for iniltraiton of lympocytes + APCs , M cells will take these up in endocytic vesicles for transcytosis 
---

levator veli palatini 
tensor veli palatini - increase tension on soft palate

brainlab notes
The ACA provides blood to most medial aspects of the brain including medial frontal lobe, cingulate gyrus, somatosensory and motor cortices corresponding to body regions from the leg down.

The PCA provides blood to most of the posterior aspect of the brain, such as the occipital lobe.

The MCA provides blood to most lateral aspects of the brain including temporal lobe, insular cortex, somatosensory and motor cortices corresponding to body regions above the leg.
- The MCA has a deep branch that provides blood to the insular cortex (aka insular branch of the MCA). The branch can be seen by carefully opening the lateral sulcus.
