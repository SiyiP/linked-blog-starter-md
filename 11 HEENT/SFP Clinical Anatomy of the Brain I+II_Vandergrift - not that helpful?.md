visual pathway 
- photons -> eyeball -> lateral geniculate nuc 
- where the lateral geniculate nucleus - in the inferior of that 
- meyer's loop carrying onto that location 
- optic track -> lateral geniculate nuleus -> meyere's loop around that temporal horn -> wrap around the wides, thru the system and then to the occipital lobe at the end. ![[vision organization.png]]
- MCA stroke = center part of occipital lobe = very back part of pole, so we see macular central vision problem 
- pca stroke = not really a huge central vision probelm 
![[lesions along the visual pathways.png]]
2 eye problem - chiasm problem - memorize this 

see - 50 y f with left proptosis + vision loss 
- one eyeball - prechiiasmatic - monocular loss 

sphenoid sinus - seen too large of a pituitary gland - a tumor grows upwards - > **presses on the optic chiasm that is right above the sella turcica**
- we get vision loss


asymmetrity- in the trigone of the ventricular system in the occipital part - cathcing all the infiltrate in the optic nerve -> pushes into the tissue 


ppl w seizures -**from the temporal lobe or hippocampus**
- before hte operation u make sure they have one on the other side too 
- cutting out those parts = cure of seizures potentially 
- giving them a meyer's loop lesion in the temporal lobe 
	- whch loops up the top of the temporal horn 
- we get a pie n the sky - if we cut the R temporal lobe out, we get pie in the sky in **both eyes bc it's retrochiastmatic.**

central skullbase
CN1 = floor anteriro cranial fossa along ethmoid block 
cN2 = subarachnoid segment, optic canals, orbial apex, orbital vault 
CN3,4,6 - subarachnoid seg, cavernous sinus, SOF , 6 is more dorsal/lateral to carotid all others are on the sinus wall 
CN 5 = 
- lat wall of cavernous sinus except V3 in ovale
- foramen rotundum V2 
V1-> superior orbital fissure


think of the pituitary tumors
- the adenohypothysis = from ectoderm in roof of the stomodeum  = depression bt the brain + pericardium of the embryo - in the anterior extremity of primitive brain and in front of the anterior extremity of endoderm 
- neurohypophysis - diencephalic in origin 
- there's brain parts and mouth parts
- part bt it = raphes cyst
- think of your anatomy around it 
- anterior lobe - makes hormones 
	- recall makes prolactin, which is under inhibitory control from the hypothalamus 
	- overproduction = galactorrhea 
	- gonadotropins - underproduction = amenoorrhea , loss of libido - basically squashing the pituitary gland, blockage of the hormones ; LH , FSH 
	- GH = makes overproduction and underproduction remember 
	- ACTH = cushing dz - overprod and underproduction = adrenal insufficiency 
	- ADH = inc water permeabiliity of distal tubules of kidney; if underproduced - diabetes insipidus 
- posterior lobe will store 

all pituitary tumors/cysts - 
- 20% have "smething in their pituitary gland"
- pituitary - benign growths of pituitary 
- from one population 
- may or may not make hormones or mass effect 
	- rathke's cleft cysts bt ant/post lobes
	- **arachnoid cysts = envelope of arachnoid that traps CSF**

prolactinomas + null cell tumors = most common 
- can cause hypoperfusion, compression by a tumor causes htis 
- compression of the stalk (which means inhibitory control is stopped) might cause unregulated prolactin production 

surgically we can....
- sugery -
- radiation - can be whole brain or focused 
- chemo - 

surgerys: 
**prolactin producing pituitary tumors = we give dopamine agonists**
some other GH makng tumors = we do surgery intead 
cushings = temp control 

think about the boney anatomy of the skull base. 
understand arterial??? - 
and venous architecture
- cavernous sinus - inflow 
	- deep/superficial MCVs
	- opththalmic veins
	- sphenoparietal sinus
- outflow - from the cavernous sinus inflow. 
	- inf petrosal sinuses
	- superior petrosal sinuses

the blown pupil. - uncus of the temporal lobe would compress intwards onto the crural cisterm, compression of CN 3 
- medial displacement of that uncus 
- epi/subdural hematoma from the car accident 
- interrupt the parasympathetics
- ***contralateral* hemiparesis from *ipsilateral* cerebral peduncle compression** 
	- the decussation !!!!

---
brain tumors 
- not that. common in brain. 
- glioblastoma multiform
- meningioma - around brain 
- guess symptoms 
- most common secondary brain tumor - from the lung 
	- usually - **small cell carcinomas - MULTIPLE SPOTS**
	- primary = just one 

radiation types 
- whole brain 
- conformal 
- stereotactic radiotherapy -> using beams on head
- stereotactic radiosurgery 

why surgery - oncologic burden reduction, seizure + headache + mass effect relief
- needle biopsy - good for very deep seated big tumors hard to remove 
- partial removal- 
- gross total resection - tumor at the surface for near 

spinal cord recall 
- myelopathy - upper motor neuron 
	- babinski, spasticity (inc tone, hyperreflex, clonus), weakness
- radiculopathy 
	- LMN signs
	- weakness, atrophy, hyporeflex, **fibrillations**
