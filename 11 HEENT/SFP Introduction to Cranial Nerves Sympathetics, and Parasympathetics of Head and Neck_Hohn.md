i would draw out pathways of CNs. what foramens? and wich structures they innervate?
focus on difficult CNs with many branches 
- like trigeminal n 
- and parasympathetic CNs 

autonomic NS
- internal organ regulation + homeostasis 
- sympathetic. + PSNS all help all these things, constantly balancing each other as physiologic antagonists
- recall -both **viseralmotor systems**
- 2 neuron chan pre and post ganglionic neurons  
- effectors - glands, smooth muscle, cardiac tissue 

sympathetic
- thoracolumbar - preganglionic sympathetic are T1-L2 preganglionic fibers exit lateral from these lateral horns 
- the ganglia are in sympathetic trunk 
- inc HR/contractility, constriction of BVs in GI, slow peristalsis of GI, relax bladder, **dilates puil in mydriasis**, constriction of BVs in skin and inc sweating 
- in visceral motor pathways
	- from lateral horn  T1-L2
	- travels leaving via ventral root and then entering into the ventral ramus intoo the **white ramus communicans...**
		- and then it synapses in the chain ganglian 
		- or it ascends and synapses in higher chain ganglia (to head)
		- or it goes down and then synapses, leaving via **gray ramus**
		- or **leave as splanchnic nerve = not synapsed in the chain, instead its synapsing in plexuses innervating the thoracic visceral organs and the lumbar ones**
			- leave without synapsing, on its way to the prevertebral ganglia onwards to the organ tissues 
- visceral afferent/sensory pathway
	- leaves target tissues, travels thru prevertebral ganglion, back thru the splanchnic nerves, back thru the white ramus, and ultimately to dorsal root ganglion which has sensory cell bodies etc. 
sympathetics to head
- from lateral horn, **between** **T1-3** = enters into the chain and ascend to reach the head in the trunk
- synapse in **superior cervical ganglion the highest ganglion in the neck**
- last ganglion of the sympathetic trunk
- postganglioninc fibers reach targets via **plexuses following the carotid arteries**

cervical sympathetic trunk + 
ganglia: 
- note that hte sympathetic trunk get no white rami communicantes in the neck, bc all the things will ascend ... between T1-L2 . **no white rami only gray**
- all will get T1-3 preganglionic fibers. 
- superior - at level C1-2 
	- exit via gray rami sending nerves to C1-4
	- cardiac br
	- carotid plexus (int/external)
- middle - at level C6 
	-  exit via gray rami sending nerves to C5-6 
	-  cardiac br
	- thyroid brs
- inferior - stellate ganglion - in the cervical region of trunk, just superior to rib one 
	- will fuse **with the T1 ganglion**
	-  exit via gray rami sending nerves to C7-8 
	- subclavian brs
	- cardiac br


parasympathetic
- craniosacral - 
- pregang fibers exit as CNs 3,7, 9, 10 or S2-4 
- ganglia all near or within target organ 
- dec HR, inc GI activity, bladder empty facilitaton, **constricts pupils/miosis**, **accomodation of lens near vision**, saliva + tearing up 

we got all these specific ganglia associated with PS cranial nerves;
COPS
- C = ciliary ganglion CN3 in the orbit 
- O = otic ganglion CN9 inner temporal fossa 
- P = pterygopalatine ganglion CN7 
- S = submandibular ganglion CN 7 
**CN 10 = will synapse at target organs**, innervates a good amt of the larynx 
- S2-4 will synapse at target organs. 
	- distal 1/3 of transverse colon + parts of UG structures
	- transition pt bt CNX + S2-4 innervation will change: between midgut and hindgut
CN nuclei 
- CNs will connect centrally to CN nuclei located in or adjacent to brainstem 
	- have affrent fibers terminate TO these, and motor fibers will come from here. 
- exceptions = CN1+2 which extensions of forebrain 
![[cranial nerve nuclei.png]]

----
- preganglioninc parasymp fibers come from nuclei in brainstem
- CN3 - has **parasymp fibers from edinger-westphal nucleus**, synapsing in **ciliary ganglion**
	- postganglionic parasympathetic ones -> sphincter pupillae muscle + ciliary muscle of accommodation 
- CN 7 - has **lacrimal *superior aspect of the superior salivatory nucleus* and the superior salivatory nucleus,** synapsing in the **pterygopalatine and submandibular ganglion**
	-  postganglionic parasympathetic ones -> lacrimal, nasal, palatine glands + submandibular + sublingual glands 
- CN 9 glossopharyngeal - has parasymp fibers from the inferior salivatory nuc -> ganglia of the otic ganglia 
	-  postganglionic parasympathetic ones -> parotid gland 
- CN 10 vagus nerve - has fibers from the nucleus ambiguus and dorsal motor nuc and going to the terminal ganglia near heart or other tissues 
	-  postganglionic parasympathetic ones -> heart lungs GI tract (to first 2/3 of transverse colon)

general pathways of CNs... memorize 
functional components of CNS
motor efferent fibers - 
- somatic motor = general somatic efferent, innvervate voluntary striated m 
- visceral motor = general visceral efferent innervate glands + invol SM 

sensory afferent fibers
- somatic sensory = general sensation touch pressure temp from skin + mucous membranes
- visceral sensory = from viscera like pain info from heart lungs, referred. 
- special sensory - unique sensations of taste/smell, hearing balance 

sensory ganglia for CNs with sensory compoennt - 5 of the CNs with sensory component actually has a sensory ganglia!
- olfactory n = none; **special sensory smell**
	- bipolar olfactory neurons form **bundles** to make many on each side
	- fibers pierce the cribriform plate 
	- bulb sends sensory information thru bulb + tract , **no ganglia bc the bulb + tract are just anterior extensions of brain**
- optic n = none ; special sense of vision 
	- paired, also anterior extensions of brain so no ganglia 
	- bring in information, relay thru optic chiasm and back thru optic tracts inot the visual cortex of occipital lobe. 
- trigeminal n -> trigeminal ganglion ;  = largest, primary supplier of sensory information 
	- CNV1 - opthalmic divison/nerve, sensory only somatic !! to skin of face, nasal mucosa + paranasal sinuses . extends up 
	- CN2 = maxillary division - only somatic sensory - to skin of face, zygomatic temporal n, paranasal sinus maxillary sinus picks up, and the oral cavity + teeth . 
	- CNV3 - supplies both somatic sensory + motor! 
		- somatic sensory - skin of face, anterior 2/3 of tongue, and oral cavity + face via auriculotemporal nerve bc it's on lateral aspect 
		- somatic motor - look below 
- facial n -> geniculate ganglion 
	- visceral motor: 
	- CN 7 travels thru the **internal acoustic meatus**, travels thru and then makes the **greater petrosal nerve from the geniculate ganglion**
	- greater petrosal nerve travels thru temporal bone -> joins the **deep petros**
	- facial sensory: 
	-  taste of anterior 2/3 of tongue -> travels back thru the **lingual nerve (br of CN V3!)** 
	- and then -> the corda tympani, br of CN 7, and then 
	- -> brainstem... 
- vestibulochochlear n CN8 -> vestibular ganglion + spiral ganglion 
- glossopharyngealn -> superior + inferior ganglia 
- vagus n -> superior + inferior ganglia 
- sensory ganglia of CNs = super similar to **dorsal root ganglia of spinal nerves, where sensory cell bodies are located**

9 CNs with motor component ; fibers from the motor nuclei traveling past those CNs
- occulomotor nuc - motor, supplies muscles moving eyeball except lateral rectus + superior oblique m  
	- somatic -> supplies levator palpebrae superioris, superior rectus, inf rectus, medial rectus, and inferior oblique m 
	- somatic motor neurons from the oculomotor nuc of the midbrain -> oculomotor nerve -> divides in the orbit , giving rise to divisions to the 
		- levator palpebrae superioris - see it first from superior 
		-  superior rectus m deep to the one above
		- medial rectus
		-  inferior oblique m 
	- also gives parasympathetic visceral innervation 
		- from the **edinger-westphal nucleus** -> oculomotor nerve -> into the orbit, where it goes into the **ciliary ganglion... synapsing**
		- -> then postganglionic parasympathetic fibers conveyed thru short ciliary nerves to sphincter pupillae - constriction of pupil 
		- -> OR  postganglionic parasympathetic fibers conveyed to ciliary muscles for lens accomodation to make lens more rounded 
- trochlear nuc - motor to the superior oblique muscle
	- from trochlear nuc -> thru trochlear n running thru lateral wall of cavernous sinus -> enters into orbit for superior oblique muscle 
- motor nuc of trigeminal n = largest, primary supplier of sensory information 
	- CNV3 - somatic motor
		- muscle to chew - mastication 
		- tensor veli palatini - in pharynx, will tense palate, preventing food from entering nasal cavity when swallowing 
		- tensor tympani m - smal muscle in middle ear
		- mylohyoid m = one of the suprahyoid muscle, upside down tent supporting the oral cavity 
		- anterior digastric belly 
- abducens nuc 
	- motor somatic, innervation of lateral rectus m, last muscle of the orbit which we haven't discussed 
	- look thru lateral aspect of orbit - see the abducens nerve travel thru **cavernous sinus, which is subject to dmg within inflammation of cavernous sinus**
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	runs on the medial belly of the lateral rectus m </mark>
- motor nuc of facial n 
	- somatic motor 
		- muscle of facial expression + posterior belly of digastric muscle 
		- and the stylohyoid muscle 
	- visceral motor aka parasympathetic to glands + mucosa 
		- preganglionic fibers are **from** the **superior salivatory nucleus** and travels thru the intermediate nerve which **joins facial nerve**
		- parasympathetic take one or 2 paths
			- innervate: submandibular, sublingual, lacrimal and mucosal of nasal cavity + palate 

- nucleus ambiguus -> glossopharyngeal n and vagus n 
- ventral horn of gray matter of cervical spinal cord -> spinal accessory n 
- hypoglossal nuc 

note that sensory + sympathetic fibers can **pass thru parasympthetic ganglia without synapsing**
- recall that the sacral preganglionic parasympathetic fibers originate and then use the sympathetic system like plexuses as a highway, traveling **thru the prevertebral ganglia** adn then don't synapse! 
- same thing in head but OPPOSITE
- **sensory and sympathetic fibers IN THE HEAD will go thru parasympathetic ganglia without synapsing**
	- there's ciliary ganglion (CN3), and preganglionic sympathetic fibers from plexus around interal carotid and then travel thru there
	- and then synapse in the sympathetic chain ganglia 
	- sensory fibers afferents do the same thing.
