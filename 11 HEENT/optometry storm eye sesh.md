common abbreviations - 
- OD = oculus dexter = right eye 
- OS oculus sinister left eye 
- OU oculus uterque both eyes 
recorded as ratio/fraction
- number 1 = distance bt patient + eye chart
- 2nd number = distance @ which letters can be read by person with normal acuity 
- 20/80 = we can recognize at 20 feet what a normal acuity patient can recognize at 80 feet. 
20 feet = 6 meters... this is where it is 
by convention test right first - with palm of hand 
**read smallest line where you can distinguish more than half the letters**
if visual acuity is 20/40 or less in 1 or both eyes, repeat test with the subj viewing thru a pinhole occluder, which might be used over their glasses. 

if they can't see the biggest leters, reduce the distance recording it as 5/70 
if they can't see it at 3 feet... hold up one hand, extend 2 or more fingers + ask them to count number of fingers.
