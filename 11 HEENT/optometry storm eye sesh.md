eye exam chapter 

Limbus The junction between the cornea and the sclera
conjunctiva - thin vascular tissue covering inner eyelids (palpebral conjunctiva) and sclera - bulbar 
anterior chambe - filled with aqueous humor 
poosterior chamber - als filled with aqueous humor behind iris + in front of vitreous 
vitreous cavity - large space behind lens 
macula - responsible for fine central vision, oval depression in center is fovea. 

visual acuity measures need to be preformed asap after age 3 . 

common abbreviations - 
- OD = oculus dexter = right eye 
- OS oculus sinister left eye 
- OU oculus uterque both eyes 
recorded as ratio/fraction
- number 1 = distance bt patient + eye chart
- 2nd number = distance @ which letters can be read by person with normal acuity 
- 20/80 = we can recognize at 20 feet what a normal acuity patient can recognize at 80 feet. 
20 feet = 6 meters... this is where it is 
by convention test right first - with palm of hand 
**read smallest line where you can distinguish more than half the letters**
if visual acuity is 20/40 or less in 1 or both eyes, repeat test with the subj viewing thru a pinhole occluder, which might be used over their glasses. 

if they can't see the biggest leters, reduce the distance recording it as 5/70 
if they can't see it at 3 feet... hold up one hand, extend 2 or more fingers + ask them to count number of fingers. 

things that suggest vision : withdrawal or change in facial expression to light oor sudden movement or brisk pupillary response to light = vision as well 

A shallow anterior chamber may indicate narrow angle  
glaucoma (also called angle closure glaucoma) or a  
narrow angle that could close with pupillary dilation. To  
assess anterior chamber depth, follow these steps:  
1. Shine a light from the temporal side of the head  
across the front of the eye parallel to the plane of  
the iris.  
2. Look at the nasal aspect of the iris. If two thirds or  
more of the nasal iris is in shadow, the chamber is  
probably shallow and the angle narrow

direct ophthalmoscope exam (traditional direct ophthalmoscope)
To perform direct ophthalmoscopy, follow these steps:  
1. Have the patient comfortably seated. Instruct the  
patient to look at a point on the wall straight ahead,  
trying not to move the eyes.  
2. Set the focusing wheel at about +8. Set the aperture  
wheel to select the large, round, white light.  
3. Begin to look at the right eye about 1 foot from the  
patient. Use your right eye with the ophthalmoscope  
in your right hand. When you look straight down  
the patient's line of sight at the pupil, you will see  
the red reflex .  
4. Place your free hand on the patient's forehead or  
shoulder to aid your proprioception and to keep  
yourself steady.  
5. Slowly come close to the patient at an angle of about  
15 degrees temporal to the patient's line of sight.  
Try to keep the pupil in view. Turn the focusing  
wheel to bring the patient's retina into focus.  
6. When a retinal vessel comes into view, follow it as it  
widens to the optic disc, which lies nasal to the  
center of the retina.  
7. Examine the optic disc, retinal blood vessels, retinal  
background, and macula in that order (see below).
- optic disc -   slightly oval in the vertical meridian and has a pink color.
- "yardstick of ocular fundus" where lesions are measured in disc diameters. 
- and see a physiologic cup in the central depression of it!!!!
Normal cup:disc diameter ratio is .3 to  .6

- larger C/D ratios = glaucoma! 
- pigmented coats of eye cresents seen in myopic eyes on temporal optic disck/?? 
- disc normally pink 
- pallor of the nerve = atrophy?? 

  
A  
similarly arranged system of retinal veins collects at the  
optic disc, where spontaneous pulsation (with collapse  
during systole) may be observed in 80% of normal eyes.  
The ratio of normal vein to artery diameter is 3:2
- Arteries are usually lighter in color than veins and  
typically have a more prominent light reflex from their  
surfaces than do veins

he central  
depression of the fovea may act as a concave mirror  
during ophthalmoscopy and produce a light reflection  
known as the foveal reflex

  
Examination of the macular  
and retinal background should be directed at detecting  
hemorrhages, exudates, or white/yellow deposits.

an IOP in the range from 10 to 21.5 mm Hg is  
acceptable, and falls within 2 standard deviations of the  
mean

vein will loop thru the optic nerve (bright spot) and artery is slightly lighter on the side 
macula + fovea in the middle 

for the provider:  
farsighted eye - needs more green numbers, 
nearsighted = more red numbers. 

lights = the 
- red-free light - to look at vessels
- small aperture - constricted pupil in a well lit room 
- blue light - corneal abrasions or ulcers with fluoresent dye 
- slit = looking at contour abnormalities
- grid = measure distances
- large light = dilated pupil after drops
- medium light= undilated pupil in dark room  

position eyes at tthe level of the instrument - positioning them and raising the seat is the easiest way 
- dim lights for best view 
- use left hand and our left eye to view patient's left eye 
- look at red reflex 
- move up + down for vessels 

swinging flashlight test is good , swinging it back. + forth from eye to eye 
- to try to rule out optic nerve lesions
