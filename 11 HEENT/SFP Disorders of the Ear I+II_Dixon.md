categorizing haring loss
- conductive - deficits before the inner ear 
	- audiograms/ear tests 
- sensorineural - after the middle/inner ear. 
- mixed
- Phys exam
	- sound has to go thru the canal, air. etc
	- in comparison we do bone conduction , vibrating ar differently 
	- weber test - at mdline + lateralizes to side of conductive loss or better hearing sensorimotor loss 
	- speech undertanding - getting clarity of sound. 
	- conductive cause - most causes are seen when looking inside the ear.!
	- rene test - put it behind on each side

infections
1. otitis externa - rapid onset, <48 but < 3 wks
	1. sypmtoms = a skin condition, ear canal inflammation, mostly t ezcema, drainage, and ppl are lookinig to help it 
	2. also caused by cleaning altogether! since earwax can prevnent this by keeping water out of air 
	3. hallmark: hurts to touch!!!
	4. tragus/pinna tenderness or diffuse erythema ?? 
	5. bacterial: p. aeruginosia, pseudomonas, s. aureus again. 
	6. ceruman - helps non-helper or citizen, most common!!! 
		1. water/cleanng/alkaline drops 
		2. derm. conditions can impact others. 
	7. water precautions until.7 day post-symptom resolving 
	8. TREAT: analgesisa
		1. topiical - much better, broad spectrum antibioti ... ciprofloxacin 
		2. systemic - only 2 instances
			1. spreading beyond EAC 
			2. can't give topical
	9. complication: necrotizing otitis externa - 
		1. gone crazy mainly bec they're immunocompromised 
		2. pseudomonas usually causes this. 
		3. necrotizin = the rot is spreading to bone specifically 
		4. super painful - otalgia , and granuloation 
	10. TREAT: drain ear 
	11. need CBCs, discharg cutlure, biopsy f granulatin bone 
2. otitis media
	1. past eardrum, behind it. can present with ear drainige but maybe j cause just have a hole
	2. acute serous otiitis media - the least relatvant, **caused by barotrauma** - resolves on its own mabye
	3. chronic serous ottitis media - reuslt of natural mechanisms making area bad. 
	4. fluid will stay around - obstructive eustachian usually - so the kids have to go with us 
		1. peak laguage development gain. we don't ant their dream to be wiped. 
		2. typically virus 
	5. in kids - observe them , bc they mainly resolve within that time. and educate parents. 
		1. very common in kids! 
		2. obstructive eustachian tube dysfunction - we see lots of viral exposures + immature immunity combinations. 
		3. common: strep pneumoniae, h. influenza 
		4. manage: with analgesia first 
		5. and antibiotics - in <2 yo with both ears with this, < 6 months old, and severe pain for more than 2 days, vfever 102.2 and higher. 
			1. **amoxicillin is huge ..... and high dose bc Strep pneumo is often really resistant. 2nd line augmentin and 3rd ceftriaxone**
	6. surgical - give equalization via tubes. 
	7. 3+ months, problems from effusion like hearing loss, speech delay, behavioral 
	8. observe + pinch nose val salva ... did not wake up 
	9. TREAT: ventilation or equalization tubes. eustachan tube balloon - 50% noramlize this sometimes not.
 3. acute suppurative OM
	 1. complications = eardrum ruptures are common. - pain in the ear but then the pain gets better then there's gross stuff coming out of the ear 
	 2. it heals by itself mostly 
	 3. surgical management when there's recurrent ear infections and when it's geting super long - that's when we think about prophalactic ones
		 1. 3 months - lasting for it will get better
		 2. around 4x a year = too many ear infections probably 
		3. we can put a tube inside their ear - doens't really prevent infections but does help drain it! 
		4. then we can treat with the ear drop antibiotics 
	4. next complications - mastoititis = it'll spread to the subperiosteal abscess - and then the mastoid - we get the ear protruding forward due to the bone, and then we have to lance the abscess. 
	5. this can spread to elsewhere, the dura, meningitis, intracranial stuff ): 
	6. get soft tissue -> complications with abscesses, facial nerve paralysis, sigmoid sinus thrombosis
 4. chronic infections 3+ months, 
	 1. constant drainage from eardrum. can be constant exposure, something trapped etc
	 2. hearing loss, facial paralysis, intracranial infection + vertigo 
	 3. TREAT: excavate everything wash the eardrums and give them a new reconstructed eardrum 
	 4. SUBTYPE: without cholesteatoma - where you have a hole in the eardrum , infections get stuck there 
		 1. debridement, topical antibiotics works 1/2 the time, surgery too 
	 5. SUBTYPE - with cholesteatoma - related to eustation tube dysfunction , skin from the eardrum grows in the wrong space... eustachion tube doesn't open like it should as freqeutnly and then there's negative pressure buildup 
		 1. TREAT: surgery mastoidectomy + tympanoplasty 

5. otosclerosis- bone remod disorder of otic capsule - but the ear looks normal externally - everything looks good
	1. but right at the stapes footplate, the ligament that is meant to be soft and supple for the stapes to vibrate ossifies!
	2. fixation of the stapes footplate - can no longer vibrate
	3. hereditary - females more than males and in both ears too 
	4. treat: surgical - **laser stapedotomy - replace with prostetic verion. 90% success, .2 losing all hearing**
	5. manage with conservative/hearing age 
	6. showing **insidious progressive hearing difficulty with conductive hearing loss**
	7. can also do a CT scan to see - subtle change in density of the both + otospongosis = typical of active sclerosis


6. age related HL - hearing + cogniftive decline 
	1. super common! 1 in 5 americans 
	2. association with many problems - reduced QOL, loneliness, social isolation, depression, etc etc. 
	3. bunch of health problems have this - some ppl might be able to reduce incidence of falls and cognitive decline by treating hearing loss + improve social networks ! 


7. sudden sensorineural hearing loss - many possibility 
	1. idiopathic most of the time
	2. workup with audiogram + MRI, where 3-10% have vestibular schwannoma 
	3. emergency - **treat with steroids, the sooner the better! intratympaniic steroids.** and hyperbaric oxygen not practically used often 
	4. prognosis, sometimes 30% recover without treatment but 65% with treatment luckily... 

neoplasms
1. vestibular schwannomas
	1. benign neoplasm of schwann cells on vestibular nerve
	2. most common intracranial tumor in the fossa... **mutation of<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">merlin, chromosome 22 tumor suppressor</mark>**
	3. **asymmetric hearing loss!**, tinnitus, imbalance
	4. sometimes - we see facial hypesthesia/parathesia - might compress trigmeminal or some type of adjacent nerve.
	5. MAnage - observe usually , or radiation with gamma knife 
2. neurofibromatosis type 2 
	1. NF gene chromosome 22 AD - codes for merlin 
	2. hallmark <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">bilateral vestibular schwannomas</mark> ; a whole bunch of typical tumors 
	3. miningiomas, cataracts, ependymomas, other tumors
	4. complicated management - observe, mediical, surgery, etc. 

tinnitis  - hearing something without an external source 
1. make sure it's not something bad
	1. subjetive vs objective 
		1. subjective - only the patient hears 
		2. objective - you can hear it if you listen closely 
	2. pulsatile vs non pulsatile 
		1. pulsatile- vascular heart sounds, carotid bruits, murmors, aberant vascular anatomy.... intracranial sounds like intracranial hypertension, dural AVF, transverse sinnus stenosis or physiologic noises like venous hum - 
			1. all coincides w heart rate 
			2. audiogram +/- imaging plus hx and exam and a bunch ... 
			3. principle of this - could be something liek aneurysm we have to treat. in vast majoriy - it's usually physiologic 
		2. nonpulsatile 
			1. all causes of hearing loss, 
			2. post concussive, temporomandibular disfunction, stress, anxiety, irritability 
			3. audiogram **but MRI ONLY if unilateral!!**
			4. Manage: rehav hearing, masking devices, CBT

part 2 - vestibular disorders 
vestibular anatomy/physio
many different sources of balance information - vision, inner ear, and proprioception which all gets integrated in the CNS, so it can be an issue or deficit of any one of those 4 things 
- semicircular canals - lat/ant/post canals, 3 paiired sensors of angular acceleration 
	- sensaton of false movement due to fluids 
- otolithic: utricle + saccule with 2 paired linear acceleration sensors! 
	- these have a mass - otoconia are like stones near the hair cells, they are heavier than the fluids, so the hair cells take some time to deflect.
- VOR = vestibuloocular reflex - keeping eyes fixed on things when u move quickly turning head side to side. 

patho
1. BPPV - the most common cause of vertgo - benign proximal positional vertigo 
	1. like crystals being loose - the 
	2. **otoconia from the utricle will break off, float in the endolyph and fall into the SCC!!! mostly posterior!**
	3. sCCs are supposed to sense angular acceleration only but with these otoconia they can now sense linear! so we get **brief seconds of rotary vertigo triggered by head movements**
	4. brain thinks you're still moving- bc of crystals jigglying 
	5. so brain fires off VOR making eyebalsl jiggle! - nystagmus 
	6. hallmark - takes couple of seconds to start, crystals float down and stops 
	7. dx: dix-hallpike maneuver + upbeat + torsional characteristic nystagmus 
	8. TREAT: move their head to get the crystals back where it's meant to be ! but has a tendency to recur! or knock it loose again. = **epley maneuver**
	9. same thing happens when u drink too much bc the fluid inner ear will be heavier **bc it gets alcohol in it** = so it's heavier and inner ear would sense the gravity!!! bc the fluid is floating thru the inner ear creating that vestibuloocular reflex! 

2. vestibular neuritis - same sensation of false movement, but **sudden onset severe vertigo for multiple days - they go to the ER**
	1. neurotropiic virus mainly impacting the inflamed vestibular nerve ... 
	2. or vascular , autoimmune. commonly follows URI
	3. labyrinthitis - **involvng both the vertigo's of vestibular nerve and hearing loss by going to cochlar nerve** 
	4. huge note - this present ssimilar to posterior circular stroke!!! so rule this out bc the membrnae could rupture with this. so give the MRI 
	5. need treat via supportive care - fluids, vestibulosuppressants like diazepam, meclizine, zofran - supportive care like antibiotics and stuff/: , 
	6. vestibular rehab with a PT is necessary bc permenant vestibular hypofunnction happens on one side 

3. meniere's disease 
	1. 2+ episodes of vertigo/dizziness lasting at least 20 min - 24 hrs 
	2. audiometrically - **low medium freq heariing loss**
	3. fluctuating symptoms like hearing + tinnitis, fullness in the affected ear - we hear maybe a whooshing etc. 
	4. pathophys - might be hydrops? - we think it's due ot how inner ear handles fluid, avoid salt, caffiiene, etc. 
	5. manage- avoid salt + caffene, give diuretics , betahistine, intratympanic dxamethasone 
	6. surgically - cut and shunt the fluid pressure of the sac? or transect vestibular nerve section or labyrinthectomy??? not common 
	7. [[HRR Vestibular Control]] throwback
4. SSCDS - superior SSC dehiscence syndrome
	1. superior canal - will communicate with the middle fossa of brain, where there's a thin layer of bone isolating that ear from intracranial cavity .... an opening of that bone -> fistula bt Superior SSC and the intracranial cavity so dura on top of that ear!!!
	2. normally - the cochlea unfurled, the stapes will vibrate in and out of labyrinth, vibrating in and out of the cochlea and the basilar membrane would vibrate.... fluid goes into the roundwindow. as the exit point . not into the labyrinth 
	3. SSCDS - third window problem, now we have that capacity for the fluid wave to go into the inner ear the labyrinth , inside the balance part of it 
	4. now **sound might make u feel dizzy! superior canal will try to fixate eyes with reflex, giving u vertigo**
	5. same thing otherway, if you **strain, raising intracranial pressure, you will give yourself PRESSURE induced vertigo, with the fluid going from dura into the labyrinth**
	6. hear pulsations - **pulsatile tinnitis with hearing BVs of the brain pulsing!!!!**
	7. surgical repair + plug this dehiscence. 
	8. also we can see the CT scan showing the bone be super small but no symptoms, this can be incidental with no symptoms. 
5. vestibular migrane 
	1. 
6. post circular strokes
