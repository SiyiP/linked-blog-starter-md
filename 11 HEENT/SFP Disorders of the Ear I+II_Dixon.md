#HEENT 
categorizing haring loss
- conductive - deficits before the inner ear 
	- audiograms/ear tests 
- sensorineural - after the middle/inner ear. 
- mixed
- Phys exam
	- sound has to go thru the canal, air. etc
	- in comparison we do bone conduction , vibrating ar differently 
	- weber test - at mdline + lateralizes to side of conductive loss or better hearing sensorimotor loss 
	- speech undertanding - getting clarity of sound. 
	- conductive cause - most causes are seen when looking inside the ear.!
	- rene test - put it behind on each side

infections
1. otitis externa - rapid onset, <48 but < 3 wks
	1. sypmtoms = a skin condition, ear canal inflammation, mostly t ezcema, drainage, and ppl are lookinig to help it 
	2. also caused by cleaning altogether! since earwax can prevnent this by keeping water out of air 
	3. hallmark: hurts to touch!!!
	4. tragus/pinna tenderness or diffuse erythema ?? 
	5. bacterial: p. aeruginosia, pseudomonas, s. aureus again. 
	6. ceruman - helps non-helper or citizen, most common!!! 
		1. water/cleanng/alkaline drops 
		2. derm. conditions can impact others. 
	7. water precautions until.7 day post-symptom resolving 
	8. TREAT: analgesisa
		1. topiical - much better, broad spectrum antibioti ... ciprofloxacin 
		2. systemic - only 2 instances
			1. spreading beyond EAC 
			2. can't give topical
	9. complication: necrotizing otitis externa - 
		1. gone crazy mainly bec they're immunocompromised 
		2. pseudomonas usually causes this. 
		3. necrotizin = the rot is spreading to bone specifically 
		4. super painful - otalgia , and granuloation 
	10. TREAT: drain ear 
	11. need CBCs, discharg cutlure, biopsy f granulatin bone 
2. otitis media
	1. past eardrum, behind it. can present with ear drainige but maybe j cause just have a hole
	2. acute serous otiitis media - the least relatvant, **caused by barotrauma** - resolves on its own mabye
	3. chronic serous ottitis media - reuslt of natural mechanisms making area bad. 
	4. fluid will stay around - obstructive eustachian usually - so the kids have to go with us 
		1. peak laguage development gain. we don't ant their dream to be wiped. 
		2. typically virus 
	5. in kids - observe them , bc they mainly resolve within that time. and educate parents. 
	6. surgical - give equalization via tubes. 
	7. 3+ months, problems from effusion like hearing loss, speech delay, behavioral 
	8. observe + pinch nose val salva ... did not wake up 
	9. TREAT: ventilation or equalization tubes. eustachan tube balloon - 50% noramlize this sometimes not.  
 3. acute, chronic 

4. otosclerosis


5. age related HL 
- hearing + cogniftive decline 

1. sudden SNHL 

neoplasms
1. vestibular schwannomas
2. neurofibromatosis

tinnitis
