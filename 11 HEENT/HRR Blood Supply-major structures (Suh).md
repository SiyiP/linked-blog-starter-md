always look at pictures and memorize like that 

CSF + metabolism - local blood flow inc 1 second after neuronal excitation 
- this cerebral Blood flow is regulate by dilation + restriction
- any light activity / neuronal firing = **proportional inc in glucose + blood flow + more dilation**
- this is why we got PET scans to light up where brain is most active

CNS - high metabolic actiivty, 15-20% of CO, continuous blood supply, but all aerobic metabolism burns glucose but never stores it 
huge CO2 buildup - will dilate this blood flow because we use more oxygen. = autoregulation with hemostatic regulation of blood flow with local arterioles to metabolites 
- brain lacks storage, so needs o2 

arteriole diameter and potassium K+ 
2 types of responses 
- too much potassium, dmg in the neurons, so flow is shut down 
- 10+ mMol results from dmg'd neurons = arterioles contract, flow shuts down, local neurons sacrified to save others. 
- 0-10 mMol from change in neuronal activity with <4 less flow and >4 more flow 

CNS **blood flow constant in spite of changes in systemic bp 0- this is autregulation**
- low bp => dilation of arterioles
- high bp-> constriction of arterioles 
	- htn can shift how your brain's baseline is and what happens. 
	- if you bring down the bp too quickly it will think it's hypertensive = think f strokes + bleeds, be careful with bringing their bp down bc their body thinks it's much lower than it is = **chronic htn shifts range up ward.**
- results in constant flow over MAP 60-160 mmHg

arterial supply to the CNS 
- 4 big highways
- common carotids - one on each side in the front 
	- becomes internal and external 
	- internal carotid going to the brain - feeds much of the brainpower becoming the anterior and middle cerebral artery , 
		- MCA from ICA -> lateral hemispheres on ipsilateral sides 
		- ACA from ICA -> going into anterior 2/3 of **medial hemisphere on respective sids**
		- this will go into making the circle of willis - connections
			- anterior posterior connection with the MCA=ACA to basillar + PCA via the posterior communicating artery 
			- RL connection with the anterior communication artery 
			- intracranial-extracranial connection = with the internal carotid to the external carotid via the **ophtalmic artery which i guess technically isn't the circle.**
			- any gradual blocks = > communicating arteries can widen, providing alternative pathways! **some collateral flow can be given!** 
			- aneurysms common in these sharp turn circle areas 
		- mainly supplying the front 
- and vertebral arteries in the back -> making the basillar artery 
	- basillar artery -> PCA -> covers the **ventromedial temporal lobe + medial occipital lobe**
	- will become the posterior crebral artery 
	- and this VA will also make some major branches
		- anterior spinal artery 
		- 3 cerebellar arteries (down to up)
			- VA-> PICA - posterior inferior cerebrellar arteries 
			- caudal basillar arteries -> anterior inferior cerebellar arteries
			- rostral basillar artery -> superior cerebellar arteries 
		- brainstem branches 
- just know - each cerebral artery has penetrating branches that supply deeper structures
	- diencephalon, basal nuclei, internal capsule 
	- **internal capsule = there's many different portions ; MCA involved for it all** 
		- anterior limb => 
			- upper -> lenticulostriate from the MCA
			- lower -> lower recurrent a of the huebner - from the ACA ; think of it as "it does the opposite... even tho it's lower, it's supplied by the anterior"
		- genu 
			- upper -> lenticulostriate from MCA
			- lower -> lenticulostriate from ICA 
		- posterior limb = > 
			- upper -> lenticulostriate from the MCA
			- lower -> anterior choroidal artery from the ICA/middle 

there's not much overlap unfortunately - 

penetrating brs of the brainstem - we have more slices 
spino-medullary junction 
- ventromedial wedge - supplied by brs of the **anterior spinal artery.** 
- intermediate wedge = supplied by brs from **vertebral artery** = fills the lower neck area (from the subclavian arteries originally)
- dorsolateral wedge is supplied by the brs of **posterior spinal artery** 
open medulla - one level above!
- ventromedial webge <- anteror spinal artery 
- intermediate wedge - vertebral artery brs
- dorsolateral wedge -<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> PICA , posterior inferior cerebellar artery! </mark>
caudal pons 
- ventromedial wedge supplied by paramedian penetrators from the basillar
- intermediate wedge is supplied by short circumfrential from basillar artery 
- dorsolateral wedges are supplied by branches of the AICA, anterior inferior cerebellar artery 
mid pons - higher ones 
- ventromedial - paramedian penetrators from BA 
- intermediate - short circum from basillar 
- dorsolateral - brs of the basillar 
rostral midbrain 
- ventromedial wedge - paramedian penetrators from BA 
- intermediate wedge by brs of PCA or posterior cerebral a 
- dorsolateral by the brs of SCA superior cerebral a 


spinal artery supply - 
- anterior spinal artery = a single one, supplying the anterior 2/3 of spinal cord. 
	- and syncitial supply from several radicular brs. 
	- beginning from vertebral then branches off aorta. 
- posterior spial artery - 1/3 posterior of this - one on both sides, numerous branches enter w dorsal roots 

artery of adamkiewicz-
- at the thoracic level, we realize we need more blood!
- so this special artery which origin can vary T9-11 **suppleies more towards our anterior spinal artery!**
- usually from the left. 
- this comes off the aorta. if it gets blocked, **if you get surgery on ur aorta causing blockage of here... can cause spinal cord ischemia**

what supplies the thalamus? 
- it's deep 
- more to the back/occipital lobe  
- and it's gonna be supplied by the PCA
