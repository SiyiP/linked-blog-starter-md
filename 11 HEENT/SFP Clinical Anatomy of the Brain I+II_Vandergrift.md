visual pathway 
- photons -> eyeball -> lateral geniculate nuc 
- where the lateral geniculate nucleus - in the inferior of that 
- meyer's loop carrying onto that location 
- optic track -> lateral geniculate nuleus -> meyere's loop around that temporal horn -> wrap around the wides, thru the system and then to the occipital lobe at the end. ![[vision organization.png]]
- MCA stroke = center part of occipital lobe = very back part of pole, so we see macular central vision problem 
- pca stroke = not really a huge central vision probelm
