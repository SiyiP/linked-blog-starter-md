the lateral border of the temporal and infratemporal fossa = made by ramus of the mandible. 
angle of mandible is the jaw angle 
coronoid process - more posterior, making temporomandibular joint
- the mandibular notch in the medial side and the lingula surrounding the notch on the inside of the saw jutting up 
- notice the temporal fossa
	- bound by the sup + inf temporal lines 
	- inf by the zygomatic arch 
	- anteriorly by frontal process of zygomatic bone 
	- **no posterior boundary**
	- floor of it - parietal, frontal, greater sphenoid wing, and squamous part of temporal bone 
		- pteryion suture int he middle, middle meningeal a underneath and it's weak 
contents of temporal fossa
- **tempoarlis muscle 
	- broad origin from temporal fossa + temporal fascia
	- insertion into **medial border of coronoid process + ant border of ramus**
	- innervatd by CNV3!!!
		- 2 branches run upwards and deep to the muscle 
	- elevate mandible + retract it (more posterior fibers) to close the mouth 
- deep temporal n+vessels
- sensory:  
	- **auriculotemporal n - mandibular V3, will be anterior to ear and sending branches upwards to head
		- dermatome will be upper head, mandibular strip
		- pathway: anterior to external meatus 
		- posterior to TMJ 
	- terminal brs of zygomaticotemporal n** - from V2,, maxillary division of the trigeminal , will be smaller and more near face
		- in the maxillary top dermatome 
- superficial temporal a - terminal br of external carotid 
	- biggest artery here - emerges from **superior border of parotid gland, passing posterior to temporomandibular joint but anterior to openng of external auditory meatus**
		- pulse point here! 
	- crosses the zygomatic arch 

infratemporal fossa
- deep to the skull, medial to ramus of mandble + part of zygomatic arch 
- basically this fossa + temporal fossa communicate with each other deep to zygomtic arch 
- superior - roof of greater wing of sphenoid + squamous temporal bones
- anterior - body of maxilla 
- posterior - styloid process + mandibular condyle 
	- "bony box with no bottom"
	- ![[Screenshot 2025-10-20 at 1.17.54 AM.png]]
- we see pterygomaxillary fissue due to incomplete fusion between maxillary bone + this portion of sphenoid bone - access to **more internal pterygoid palatine fossa**
- foramen ovale - lets v3 pass from the middle cranial fossa into infratemporal one
- foramen spinosum - middle meningeal a+v and meningeal br of V3 -> **from that infratemporal fossa upwards**


contents of infratemporal fossa
- temporalis m
	- occupies the infratemporal fossa 
- lateral pterygoid m 
	- upper heat from infratemporal surface of greater wing of sphenoid + lower from lateral aspect of lat pterygoid plate 
	- inserts to front of neck of mandible + articular disc of TMJ 
	- innervated by **br from anterior V3 division, pulls entire mandible forward when opening of mouth when contracting**
	- these will unite together helping open mouth , pulls mandible forward , if you contract on one side u rotate, like eating food 
	- this looks sorta straight horizontally 
- medial pterygoid m 
	- superficial head from posterior surface of maxilla and deep head from medial surface of lat plate of pterygoid 
	- inserts onto medial aspect of angle of mandible
	- this was slanted diagonal 
	- innervation by br of V3
	- elevates temporalis m , helps mouth close 
- maxillary a + branches
	- 3 parts:
	- before lateral pterygoid muscle
		- 1st part has small brs to ear
		- middle meningeal a -> into the foramen spinosum and ascends into cranial cavity , surrounded by the split in auriculotemporal n !!! good landmark 
		- inferior alveolar a - stretching down slightly near the alveoli , runs with the inf alveolar n 
	- overlapping lateral pterygoid = 2nd part 
		- muscular br to the masseter. 
		- bucal a = cheeks 
		- deep temporal a - ant + post to temporalis m 
	- after the lateral pterygoid = 3rd part more medial to lat pterygoid m = 4 terminal brs, 
		- sphenopalatine
		- infraorbital
		- posterior superior alveolar 
		- descending palatine - 
- pterygoid plexus venous - mirrors drainage of maxillary a 
	- just know - that this communcates with **opthalmic veins (in middle cranial cavities near the sinus) + facial v**
- mandibular division of CNV and brs- sensory + motor innervation ; V3
	- unlike V1/2 they don't move horizontally, but **downward projection in middle cranial fossa -> infratemporal fossa**
	- we expect to see the auricular temporal n so the middle meningeal a too 
	- from the main trunk: from v3 itself
		- meningeal br = sensory , thru spinosum into middle cranial fossa 
		- n to medial pterygoid m , motor br 
		- 2 brs to tensors  = 2 tensor muscles; the tensor veli palatini + tensor tympani 
	- from anterior division  branches 
		- masseteric n - massenter muscle 
		- 2 deep temporal nn =- motor , 
		- n  to lateral pterygoid m - 
		- buccal nerve (sensory) 
	- posterior division - largest of the 3 
		- auriculotemporal n = 2 roots embracing meningeal a ;
			- this carries **postganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the parotid gland, from the otic ganglion**
			- giving motor to parotid glands. 
		- lingual nerve 1= descends into the oral cavity, gets br of facial nerve called chorda tympani 
			- runs downward + ant to inf alveolar nerve
			- will run from posterior division o the 3 and then passes forward + medial to tongue, 
				- sensory innfervation ant 2/3 of tongue + a lot of taste!!!=
				- chorda tympani from CN 7 joinst this ilngual n ; **chorda tympani will pass thru the petrotympanic fossa**
			- this gets combined with the chorda tympani CN7
			the information will get to empty on facebook lol 
		- inf alveolar n = 2 has motors and sensory fibes , giving off the mylohyoid n , predom sensory + **gives off the mylohyoid motor nerve!!!** and also provides inf belly of the digastric too sometimes 
			- carries to the behind of it 
			- sensory + motor together. 
			- run below teeth to split into incisive br + mental nerv
			- do they need to step back 
			- **gives off a nerve to mylohoid nerve!!!!!!!**
			- sphenomandibular accessory helps out 
- otic ganglion - parasympathetic ones, COPS 

 temporomandibular joint
 - synovial between head and neck (condyloid process of mandible + articular tubercle + nifratemporal great )
 - articular disk - makes this joint. 
 - ligaments
	 - lteral temporomandibular ligament - reinforces the capsle 
	 - sphenomandibular ligamnet - pierced by myohoid nerve, and then thin br will be preserved. most medial? 
	 - stylomandibular ligament - thin band from styloid process + mandible 
- movements
	- initally opning mouth - the hinge-like motion
	- as you open more - **jaw needs to protrude more!!! the mandible slid forward on the articular tubercle**
	- lockjaw - head moved far anteriorly , 

- masseter m 
	- from lower border + media zygomatic arch 
	- insertion onto lateral aspect of ramus of mandible 
	- V3 innervation, will raise the mandible 
	- **if there's lesion to mandibular nerve, we're only able to contract muscles on unaffected side! so rotation of jaw TOWARDS AFFECTED SIDE!**
