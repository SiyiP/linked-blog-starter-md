![[1. Skull_Reaves_NOTES (1).pdf]]

has all the structures we'll talk abt at the end - surface anatomy 
![[skull surface anatomy.png]]
2 divisions
- cranium / neurocranium - the bulk of the skull itself, like the back of head... 
- face = viscerocranium 

nasion - top of the nose bone 
vertex- top portion 
pterion - where the bones meet together on the side. 
asterion 
externlal occipital protuberance. 
lamdoid is the posterior structure. 
![[skull landmarks.png]]

calvaria - the top of skull 
- frontal bone 
- parietal bones has 2 
- and upper part of occipital bone has 1 

sutures = frontal suture
sagittal, 
lambdoid too 

landmarks: 
bregma - the frontal portion
lamda area = the midline down but more near the back of head 

learning the bones - each has orifice or some things 
we look up from inferior view
foramina - convey the blood vessels and nerves 

- occipital - on the base, 
- parietal - on the side 
- temporal - on the side, more bigger and associated with cheeks
- sphenoid - has the lesser wing and greater wing 
- zygomatic 
- maxilla, 
- palatine 
- volmer 

fontanelles - **space between bones of skull in an infant/fetus when developping, pre-ossification completion and pre-suture formation. main one is between frontal and parietal bones**
we look at all these from top down view. 
- anterior - bregma , **horizontal** fissure in front 
- posterior = lambda , horizontal fissure in back 
- anterolateral spheronoidal / pterion - on the side of head 
- posterolateral = mastoid / asterion - near the bak side, near the mastoid 
- anterior fontanelle - soft til 2nd year - small space, the diamond on the top of baby head 
- metopic suture = normally closes 1-3 years, fused by 4-6th year, may persistn sometimes. this is  line straight down the middle near the forehead ; 10% open happens in developping fetus/infant 

cranial fossae
anterior cranial fossa - frontal lobes of brain
- superior orbital plate - frontal bone, eye underneath that
- frontal crest - a little ridge that is in the middle of the both frontal bones of each side. 
- superior sagittal sinus - anterior cranial fossa??
- crista galli - follows the frontal crest down a bit more
- cribriform plate - on the wall where ts near the crista galli/frontal crest. wewill see ths in lab, there's holes that are meant for the olfactory bulb / to pass thru here. 

middle cranila fossa - posterior ot **lesser wing of sphenoid bone**
- has temporal lobes

posterior cranial fossa
- posterior to the **petrous ridge of the temporal bone.** (the petrous ridge is visible from the bottom up look, we see a clear ridge there.)
- has cerebrum, pons, medulla oblongata. 

middle cranial fossae
has many parts 

![[middle cranial fossae.png]]
- middle meningeal a - impressions seen on both sides, seen arching off the sides of each bone
	- this is a br off the maxillary artery 
- carotid canal -  not seen that well that will travel into the brain with the internal carotid a 
- dotted lines = sella turcica
- F = pituitary gland 
- anterior clinoid process A - nerves associated with this, important to see and understand
- T = tuberculum sellae - **in the pituitary cyst, like a saddle.**


posterior cranial fossae
- petrous ridge - temporal bone
- body - sphenoid bone
- occipital bone
- clivus 
- foramen magnum - the large opening - many passing thru that 
- internal occipital protuberance - we have an external one in similar area
- posterior meningieal a - impressions here. bilateral
- grooves for 
	- superior petrosal sinus
	- and inf petrosal sinus
	- sigmoid sinus 
	- superior sagittal sinus (end)

dural venous sinuses 
- reflections of layers of dura make passages for **venous blood**
- impressions 
- petrosal - sup and inferior .. on same plane
- sigmoid sinus is in occipital ... looks like a sigma 
- transverse sinus 
- these are all impressions in the skull 
- falx cerebri has sup + inf sagittal 
- tentorium cerebelli has striaght, transverse, superior petrosal 
- cavernous sinus 

occipital bone - inf portion looking onto it 
- this is the posterior of the skull - occipital which surrounds large opening foramen magnum 
- anterior part - basilar
- posterior = squamous part 

external 
- sup + inf nuchal lines
- external occipital protuberance
articulations within the sphenoid bone + temporal + parietal bones 
jugular foramen - interosseus 
articular condyles = C1 vert, and condylar canal, which is **intraosseous, posterior, don't get these fucked up**
hypoglossal canal 


sphenoid bone - 
- middle of skull base 
- body - sella turcica
- greater + lesser wings
- articulations -
	- frontal
	- parietal 
	- temporal 
	- occipital 
	- ethmoid
- end of carotid canal - at foramen lacerum 
- important foramina - sup orbital fissure, foramen rotunda, foramen spinosum, foramen ovale, pterygoid canal, oramen lacerum, optic canal 
- evntually know what passs thru them 

pterygoid process - one for each muscle 
- lateral pterygoid plate
- medial pterygoid plate 
- hamulus - a medial hook of hamulus seen 

foramina - foramen oval + spinosum 
pterygoid canal - passing under the medial pterygoid plate! 


temporal bone
- squamous portion 
- mastoid process, styloid process
- tympanic portion - at ext acoustic meatus
- articulates with occipital, parietal, greater wing of sphenoid, zygomatic 
- red - temporal process of zygomatic bone, which is in the facial portion following the zygomatic arch 
- temporomandibular joint - lets us chew food, movable synovial joint with head of mandible at mandibular fossa - highly mobile and has to be!!!

temporal bone inside of skull 
- arcuate eminence, bowl protrusion - anterior semicircular canal, anterior to this 
- tegmen tympani - roof of ear area, tympanic cavity 
- carotid canal - close to the foramen 

squamous portion - in the middle cranial fossa
- has impressions of middle miningial fossa

middle meningeal a - at pterion 
- can be a weaker area, and then can be bleeding here. 
- from max a in infratemporal fossa thru foramin spinosum 
- 


hiatus + groove for greter petrosal n 
ihatus for lesser petrosal n 
internal acoustic meatus - CN 8 + 7 
- geniculum of fascial nerve 

course of internal carotid artery - no br go into teh brain 
1. medially thru carotid canal in petrous part of temporal bone
2. anterior thru cavernous sinus 
3. past anterior slinoid process of sphenoid bone
carotid "siphon" bc it's s shaped 
doesn't pass thru foramen lacerum but close to it 


orbit - bones near the eye 
- frontal, greater wing sphenoid, zygomatic, maxilla, palatine, lacrimal , ethmoid
- optic canal suprior and otherwise

ethmoid bone 
- in anterior fossa - bt orbital plates of frontal bone as an oyster looking thing 
- ???

pneumatized bone - bone with holes in it 
- ethmoidal air cells, and has holes for air articulation 
nasal septum has 3 parts - ehmoid, palpatine and volver. 

interior alveolar a + n will pass thru the mandibles 

temporomandibular joint
- mandibular fossa in the middle with articular disk + tubercle
- ligaments are named here 2 of these 

![[landmarks and foramina skull.png]]![[landmarks and foramina lateral view.png]]![[landmarks of skull bottom up view.png]]![[foramina of skull.png]]

air densities - nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses
water desnitties, bone desntieis too

pathology 
1. skull base disorder 
2. tumors
3. vasc pocesses
4. infections
5. congenital dz - chiari, basilar 

common - meningioma 
- from specifically arachnoid layer 
- common type of primary brain tumor particularly in adults 
- mostly slow growign but some aggro 
- most benign , some malignant
