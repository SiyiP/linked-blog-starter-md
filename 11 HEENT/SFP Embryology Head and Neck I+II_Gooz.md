go watch the actual lecture!!!! 

----

CNS dev - spans the entire 9 month ; continues into the formative years after birth
- 3-8 wks = most vulnerable window 

craniofacial region - skull + face , 3 embryonic sources 
- paraxial mesoderm 
- lateral plate mesoderm 
- NCCs

from occipital region of head -> sacral, the **paraxial mesoderm makes** somiites of either side of the developing neural tube! 

iin cranial region, **mesenchyme anterior to occipital somites** condnses into structures like **somitomeres** = basically somites but more loosely organized, unsegmented. 

bones of face + skull = derived from combo of somitomeres, occipital somites, NCCs. 
- frontal skull structures = NCC segments. 
- paraxial mesoderm derivatives = **somites + somitomeres**  in the back of head like in parietal bone, occipitalis, and petrosal temporal bone 
- laryngeals = lateral plate mesoderm , like near the spinal cord and downwards. 

neurocranium - enclose brain, 
viscerocranium - associated with pharyngeal arches, AND surrounding oral cavity, the pharynx and upper respiratory tract 

the boney structures of H+N -> develop thru: (these will all be in the centers of either neurocranium + viscerocranium)
- intramembranous ossification - 
- endochondral ossification - think cartilage 

the pharyngeal arch region - of human embryo at end of 1st month 
- each arch has its specific - arch arteries, nerves, muscles, skeletal structures
- human's don't have 5th pharyngeal arch ; we got arches, 6th aortic arch and stuff
- segmental pattern - reflects spatial expression of Hox genes, which guides regional identity during dev
