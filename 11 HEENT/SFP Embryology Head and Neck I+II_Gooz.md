go watch the actual lecture!!!! 

----

CNS dev - spans the entire 9 month ; continues into the formative years after birth
- 3-8 wks = most vulnerable window
- craniofacial stuructres - they develop over extended embyonic period - vulnerability to teratogens like 
	- retinoic acid, alc, thalidomide 


craniofacial region - skull + face , 3 embryonic sources 
- paraxial mesoderm 
- lateral plate mesoderm 
- NCCs - many feat come from this so any brief exposure -> cleft palate, micrognathia, etc. 
axial skeleton - skull, verte column, ribs, sternum 
- these arise from paraxial mesoderm, lateral plate mesoderm, NCCs 
![[embryonic mesodermlayout.png]]
NCCs would develop near that neural tube as it closes 
- somites formed from paraxial mesoderm , lookng like **little bumps.... occipital to sacral regions beside the neural tube**
- around the head region - the mesenchyme doesn't condense and are more loose so **somitomeres will be there.** so it's not only develpment of the axial skeleton but also head and neck. 

from occipital region of head -> sacral, the **paraxial mesoderm makes** somiites of either side of the developing neural tube! 

iin cranial region, **mesenchyme anterior to occipital somites** condnses into structures like **somitomeres** = basically somites but more loosely organized, unsegmented. 


bones of face + skull = derived from combo of somitomeres, occipital somites, NCCs. 
- frontal skull structures = NCC segments. 
	- neural crest cells -> hyoid, mandible, facial bones in general 
- paraxial mesoderm derivatives = **somites + somitomeres**  in the back of head like in parietal bone, occipitalis, and petrosal temporal bone
- laryngeals = lateral plate mesoderm , like near the spinal cord and downwards. 

neurocranium - enclose brain, protective case around it 
viscerocranium - associated with pharyngeal arches, AND surrounding oral cavity, the pharynx and upper respiratory tract
- all the cavity protections 


the boney structures of H+N, so both of these ^^ -> develop thru: 
- intramembranous ossification - 
- endochondral ossification - think cartilage 

the pharyngeal arch region - of human embryo at end of 1st month ; a bit over 3 weeks... 
we see 1+2nd pharyngeal arches

pharyngeal clefts - little chins or pouches. 
in a bit tho the 5th would recess and then the 6th will also stay to contribute to the structures in the head + neck 
- these resemble fish gills in humans 
- pharyngeal clefts separate the mesenchymal bars which make up the pharyngeal arches ; the arches are **paraxial mesoderm + Neural crest contributing to the center mesenchymal mass**
- each arch has its specific - arch arteries, nerves, muscles, skeletal structures
- human's don't have 5th pharyngeal arch ; we got arches, 6th aortic arch and stuff
- segmental pattern - reflects spatial expression of Hox genes, which guides regional identity during dev 
![[Screenshot 2025-10-28 at 1.27.30 PM.png|235x264]]
at week 5 we can see 1,2,3, and 6.... arches made up of mesenchyme and then the condensed tissue differentiates into arteries, nerves, muscles, skeletal structures
- recall the heart and blood vessels develop from these. 
- these tissues will develop and drag along nerve and artery - 
- recurrent laryngeal nerve - ends up on different parts of the body on either side bc of the way it develops 
- each arch = is **lined** = 
	- endodermal tissue = on the inside, forms pouches
	- ectoderm will ine the outside, making pharyngeal clefts

basic patterning 
recall - the HOX gene expression - important for patterning in the head region 
- no hox gene expression cranially to the first arch 


facial prominence dev 
- the **stomodeum. = the hole on the face as a depression, develops into the mouth**
- two dots = **nasal placodes = ectodermal thickenings invaginate to make the nasal pits -> nostrils, which contribute to olfactory stuff**

facial primordia 
- frontonasal prominence = these develop from NCCS
	- these are unpaired , next to the 2 nasal placodes 
	- in wk 5 placodes invaginate to make the nasal pits 
	- surrounding tissue makes the prominences
		- lateral nasal = outer edges
		- medial nasal prom - inner edge f pit 
		- these structures contribute to the nose (both) and upper lip ( only medial porominence)
	- fusion of medial nasal prominences - formation of that 
		- philtrum of upper lip 
		- fleshy nasal septum 
		- premaxillary part of maxilla (incisor teeth)
			- this will be the 4 incisor teeth which is surroundd by that parimary palate 
		- primary palate, anterior ot that incisive foramen - making a filter and stuff. 
			- our primary palate is made - and t's rough right now coming from medial nasal promeneince and now felt still -> intermaxillary segments 

overall palate dev timeline 
![[Screenshot 2025-10-28 at 1.50.47 PM.png]]
-  maxillary prominences right above that stomodeum and the line that goes thru it ; paired 
	- these 5-7 wks enlarge + grow medially... 
	- this compresses medial nasal prominences to the midline 
	- these will push the **medial prominences otgether, making the onse from the half**
	- the fusion of the upper lip : 
		- note that instead, the **medial** **nasal** prominence = philtrum 
		- 2 of the **maxillary** prominences come together
	- note - **lateral nasal prominences don't contribute to the upper lip**
	- nasolacrimal groove - between the **maxillary + lateral nasal prominences**
		- that groove -> lacriimal duct into the tear drainage from eye to nasal cavity 
	- secondary palate - formed with palatal shelves of maxillary prominences which appear in week 6 
		- shelves grow medially + vrtically then **elevat + fuse**
		- thiis fusion would happen with each other at midline, primary palate gets anterior + nasal septum gets more superior 
		- the tongue stops the fusion... we need to wait for the tongue to go lower.  
		- head elongates, allowing the palatal shelves to move and grow mediallY + vertically again 
		- **complete usion with each other + primary palate = definitive palate**
			- this separates oral + nasal cavities 
			- 
 
- mandibular prominences - paired = under that line 
	- forms the lower lip and jaw , merges in the middle
	- minor variations in fusion -> chin dimple 
	- **meckels cartilage = is made as structural template**
		- def lower jaw **develops AROUND it as intramembranous ossification**
		- and the meckel's cartilage contributes to other structures:
			- malleus + incus (middle ear)
			- sphenomandibular ligament 
			- rare to have abnormalities in this lower part 
- lower part of face = develops from the first pharyngeal arch

formaton of nose + olfactory stuff
- begins with the nasal placodes in frontonasla prominence 
- -> nasal pits 
- roof of nasal cavity -> olfacotry epithelium in weeks 6-7 
- pits are bordered by the medial + lat nasal prominences 
- an oronasal membrane would separate the nasal pit from the oral cavity 
	- as time passes this will breka down, causing nasal + oral cavities to connect via nasal chonae - **superior + poterior to primary palate.**-> 
	- ectodermal cells to diffrentiate into olfactory epithelium in weeks 7-8 
- on the other hand, epiithelial plug - at nasal pit openings, persists til 4 mon, removed via apoptosis , closigng it from the outside 

nasalc avity <= superficial ectoderm 
oral cavity lining =< oral ectorderm 
oral cavity <- from keeping healthyu 


----
devel of paranasal sinuses
- they arise as divercula from the nasal wall 
- 2 bones - maxilla, ethmoid, frontal, sphenoid ; some are congenital, 
- reach max size during puberty 
- contribute to shape of head + voic dev

malformations 
1. cleft lip - involving the **medial and maxillary prominences**
	1. uniilat or bilat 
	2. in upper lip 
	3. more common in men 
2. cleft plate - palatine shealves + ns=asal septum. 
	1. form the maxillary, palate hard and / or soft 
	2. fused here - involving the medionasal prominnence 
	3. deep maxillary -> cleft palatebc iimpacting the ppl by th big commercial 
	4. lke a cleft but fused? 

combned cleft lip bilaterally and palate = from the **medionasal prominence**, how thye fused - maxillary prominence,s palatine shelves, nasal septum 
- laterally cna be uni or bilateral 
- affects both upper lip + palate (hard and/or soft)
- feeding, speech etc. req multidisciplinary care 


rare clefts
- oblique facial cleft - failed fuion of lateral nasal and maxilary prominences. going from 
	- wide cleft form upper limpt o lower limg 
- macrostomia - huge mouth 
	- lateral facial cleft - huge mouth, ften uniilateral
	- incomplete fusionof maxillary + mandibular prominences, muscles of facial expresion impacte 
- median cleft lip - incomplete merge fo **medial nasal prominences**
	- this is what it sounds like a midlint cleft from upper liip to the nose 
	- can be associated with CNS/ brain activities 

frontal nasal dysplasia - wide set midline 
- spectrum can be sen in malformations duet o abnormal dev 
	- hypertelorism = wide set eyes
	- broad nasal root 
	- midline facial clefts
	- brain or skull anomalies 
	- embyolologically these get disrupted n frontonasal prominence dev, so proper fusion failure or thorwn off bc of medial nasal structure
	- try to do surgitcal corection + imging and consultations - looks like avatar
