go watch the actual lecture!!!! 
![[pharyngeal apparatus simple]]
----

CNS dev - spans the entire 9 month ; continues into the formative years after birth
- 3-8 wks = most vulnerable window
- craniofacial stuructres - they develop over extended embyonic period - vulnerability to teratogens like 
	- retinoic acid, alc, thalidomide 
![[derivatives of pharyngeal arches chart.png]]

craniofacial region - skull + face , 3 embryonic sources 
- paraxial mesoderm 
- lateral plate mesoderm 
- NCCs - many feat come from this so any brief exposure -> cleft palate, micrognathia, etc. 
axial skeleton - skull, verte column, ribs, sternum 
- these arise from paraxial mesoderm, lateral plate mesoderm, NCCs 
![[embryonic mesodermlayout.png]]
NCCs would develop near that neural tube as it closes 
- somites formed from paraxial mesoderm , lookng like **little bumps.... occipital to sacral regions beside the neural tube**
- around the head region - the mesenchyme doesn't condense and are more loose so **somitomeres will be there.** so it's not only develpment of the axial skeleton but also head and neck. 

from occipital region of head -> sacral, the **paraxial mesoderm makes** somiites of either side of the developing neural tube! 

iin cranial region, **mesenchyme anterior to occipital somites** condnses into structures like **somitomeres** = basically somites but more loosely organized, unsegmented. 


bones of face + skull = derived from combo of somitomeres, occipital somites, NCCs. 
- frontal skull structures = NCC segments. 
	- neural crest cells -> hyoid, mandible, facial bones in general 
- paraxial mesoderm derivatives = **somites + somitomeres**  in the back of head like in parietal bone, occipitalis, and petrosal temporal bone
- laryngeals = lateral plate mesoderm , like near the spinal cord and downwards. 

neurocranium - enclose brain, protective case around it 
viscerocranium - associated with pharyngeal arches, AND surrounding oral cavity, the pharynx and upper respiratory tract
- all the cavity protections 


the boney structures of H+N, so both of these ^^ -> develop thru: 
- intramembranous ossification - 
- endochondral ossification - think cartilage 

the pharyngeal arch region - of human embryo at end of 1st month ; a bit over 3 weeks... 
we see 1+2nd pharyngeal arches

pharyngeal clefts - little chins or pouches. 
in a bit tho the 5th would recess and then the 6th will also stay to contribute to the structures in the head + neck 
- these resemble fish gills in humans 
- pharyngeal clefts separate the mesenchymal bars which make up the pharyngeal arches ; the arches are **paraxial mesoderm + Neural crest contributing to the center mesenchymal mass**
- each arch has its specific - arch arteries, nerves, muscles, skeletal structures
- human's don't have 5th pharyngeal arch ; we got arches, 6th aortic arch and stuff
- segmental pattern - reflects spatial expression of Hox genes, which guides regional identity during dev 
![[pharyngeal arch labes.png|235x264]]
at week 5 we can see 1,2,3, and 6.... arches made up of mesenchyme and then the condensed tissue differentiates into arteries, nerves, muscles, skeletal structures
- recall the heart and blood vessels develop from these. 
- these tissues will develop and drag along nerve and artery - 
- recurrent laryngeal nerve - ends up on different parts of the body on either side bc of the way it develops 
- each arch = is **lined** = 
	- endodermal tissue = on the inside, forms pouches
	- ectoderm will ine the outside, making pharyngeal clefts

basic patterning 
recall - the HOX gene expression - important for patterning in the head region 
- no hox gene expression cranially to the first arch 


facial prominence dev 
- the **stomodeum. = the hole on the face as a depression, develops into the mouth**
- two dots = **nasal placodes = ectodermal thickenings invaginate to make the nasal pits -> nostrils, which contribute to olfactory stuff**

facial primordia 
- frontonasal prominence = these develop from NCCS
	- these are unpaired , next to the 2 nasal placodes 
	- in wk 5 placodes invaginate to make the nasal pits 
	- surrounding tissue makes the prominences
		- lateral nasal = outer edges
		- medial nasal prom - inner edge f pit 
		- these structures contribute to the nose (both) and upper lip ( only medial porominence)
	- fusion of medial nasal prominences - formation of that 
		- philtrum of upper lip 
		- fleshy nasal septum 
		- premaxillary part of maxilla (incisor teeth)
			- this will be the 4 incisor teeth which is surroundd by that parimary palate 
		- primary palate, anterior ot that incisive foramen - making a filter and stuff. 
			- our primary palate is made - and t's rough right now coming from medial nasal promeneince and now felt still -> intermaxillary segments 

overall palate dev timeline 
![[palatal development timeline chart.png]]
-  maxillary prominences right above that stomodeum and the line that goes thru it ; paired 
	- these 5-7 wks enlarge + grow medially... 
	- this compresses medial nasal prominences to the midline 
	- these will push the **medial prominences otgether, making the onse from the half**
	- the fusion of the upper lip : 
		- note that instead, the **medial** **nasal** prominence = philtrum 
		- 2 of the **maxillary** prominences come together
	- note - **lateral nasal prominences don't contribute to the upper lip**
	- nasolacrimal groove - between the **maxillary + lateral nasal prominences**
		- that groove -> lacriimal duct into the tear drainage from eye to nasal cavity 
	- secondary palate - formed with palatal shelves of maxillary prominences which appear in week 6 
		- shelves grow medially + vrtically then **elevat + fuse**
		- thiis fusion would happen with each other at midline, primary palate gets anterior + nasal septum gets more superior 
		- the tongue stops the fusion... we need to wait for the tongue to go lower.  
		- head elongates, allowing the palatal shelves to move and grow mediallY + vertically again 
		- **complete usion with each other + primary palate = definitive palate**
			- this separates oral + nasal cavities 
			- 
 
- mandibular prominences - paired = under that line 
	- forms the lower lip and jaw , merges in the middle
	- minor variations in fusion -> chin dimple 
	- **meckels cartilage = is made as structural template**
		- def lower jaw **develops AROUND it as intramembranous ossification**
		- and the meckel's cartilage contributes to other structures:
			- malleus + incus (middle ear)
			- sphenomandibular ligament 
			- rare to have abnormalities in this lower part 
- lower part of face = develops from the first pharyngeal arch 

----
formaton of nose + olfactory stuff
- begins with the nasal placodes in frontonasla prominence 
- -> nasal pits 
- roof of nasal cavity -> olfacotry epithelium in weeks 6-7 
- pits are bordered by the medial + lat nasal prominences 
- an oronasal membrane would separate the nasal pit from the oral cavity 
	- as time passes this will breka down, causing nasal + oral cavities to connect via nasal chonae - **superior + poterior to primary palate.**-> 
	- ectodermal cells to diffrentiate into olfactory epithelium in weeks 7-8 
- on the other hand, epiithelial plug - at nasal pit openings, persists til 4 mon, removed via apoptosis , closigng it from the outside 

nasalc avity <= superficial ectoderm 
oral cavity lining =< oral ectorderm 
oral cavity <- from keeping healthyu 


----
devel of paranasal sinuses
- they arise as divercula from the nasal wall 
- 2 bones - maxilla, ethmoid, frontal, sphenoid ; some are congenital, 
- reach max size during puberty 
- contribute to shape of head + voic dev

malformations 
1. cleft lip - involving the **medial and maxillary prominences**
	1. uniilat or bilat 
	2. in upper lip 
	3. more common in men 
2. cleft plate - palatine shealves + ns=asal septum. 
	1. form the maxillary, palate hard and / or soft 
	2. fused here - involving the medionasal prominnence 
	3. deep maxillary -> cleft palatebc iimpacting the ppl by th big commercial 
	4. lke a cleft but fused? 

combned cleft lip bilaterally and palate = from the **medionasal prominence**, how thye fused - maxillary prominence,s palatine shelves, nasal septum 
- laterally cna be uni or bilateral 
- affects both upper lip + palate (hard and/or soft)
- feeding, speech etc. req multidisciplinary care 


rare clefts
- oblique facial cleft - failed fuion of lateral nasal and maxilary prominences. going from 
	- wide cleft form upper limpt o lower limg 
- macrostomia - huge mouth 
	- lateral facial cleft - huge mouth, ften uniilateral
	- incomplete fusionof maxillary + mandibular prominences, muscles of facial expresion impacte 
- median cleft lip - incomplete merge fo **medial nasal prominences**
	- this is what it sounds like a midlint cleft from upper liip to the nose 
	- can be associated with CNS/ brain activities 

frontal nasal dysplasia - wide set midline 
- spectrum can be sen in malformations duet o abnormal dev 
	- hypertelorism = wide set eyes
	- broad nasal root 
	- midline facial clefts
	- brain or skull anomalies 
	- embyolologically these get disrupted n frontonasal prominence dev, so proper fusion failure or thorwn off bc of medial nasal structure
	- try to do surgitcal corection + imging and consultations - looks like avatar

dev of pharynx + derivatives

adult derivs of pharyngeal arches
6 form during dev
1st arch - cartilage along the mandibles + 2 ossicls 
muscles on facial expression - 2nd pharyngeal arch, innervation by the facial nerve + the stepes 
3rd arch - the stylopharyngeus + part of hyoid bone 
4th arch - pharyngeal muscles - also the thyroid + cricocartilages 
muscles from trigeminal arch - chewing 
6th arch -> laryngeal cartilages like 4th arch... -> recurrent laryngeal nerve. 

![[pharyngeal derivatives of pouches and clefts.png]]
inside - the pharyngeal pouches on the right 
and on the left, we have the grooves/clefts that fit inside. 
derivatives of arches 1-4 

1st pharyngeal groove - ectodermal origin 
- outside - groove or cleft, which are like valleys 
- this is the **only one to persist into adulthood as the external auditry meatus**, outer part of tympanic membrane
- pouch 1 = the tympanic cavity - middle ear cavity, eustachian tube 
- audiitory tube connects pharynx + middle ear 
grooves 2-4 - cervical sinus which will eventually disappear 
- **this normally will regress + disappear**
- pouch 2 = palatine tonsil - epithelial lining of tonsilar fossa 
- 3rd pouch = inferior parathyroid glands, thymus ; will start moving downwards while they are dragging the parathyoid glands with it 
	- this will migrate further 
- 4th pouch = superior parathyroid glands, ultimobranchial body  = some of the parathyroid glands + tissue from which the **parafollicular c cells of thyroid develop**
	- this parathyroid will descend with the thyroid gland itself. 
	- they will be superior to the other parathyroid from the 3rd pouch. they move less. careful with this. key 

thyroid dev - endodermal origins - bt the 1+2 pharyngeal pouches initially.... 
	- thyroid will be primordial, developping in the middle, diving deep into the **foramen cecum, seen in the tongue + move downwards.**
		- this will leave the foramen cecum at the base of tongue as it goes into the neck 
	- miigration -> will travel in that thyroglossal duct, picking up the 4th pouch parathyroids + then move in front of larynx + cartilage 
	this duct can **persist and then get infected !!! thyroglossal duct**

pituitary gland dev - dual ectodermal origins
- one part: 
- neuroectoderm- **posterior pituitary, no hormones produced from the floor of the diencephalon**; but stores the hypothalamus stuff 
	- will eventually release the neurohrmoones from hypothalamus 
	- starts as infundibulum = from the neuroectoderm 
- oral ectoderm - from **rathke's pouch an invagination near the stomodeum, forming the anterior pituitary**
	- anterior lobe - makes hormones GH, ACTH, TSH 
	- eventually rathke's pouch losings their connection to that oral cavity... this was the part of the notochord? 

tongue dev - from primarily 1+3rd primary contributers
- 4 swellings ... 
first arch 
- front part of tongue, 2/3rds anterior from the **first arch**
- middle of tongue that becomes more posterior midline = **tuberculum impar**
- lateral lingual swellings will surround the tuberculum impar 
- CN5 wll develop there - providing general somatosenstion 
2nd arch 
- gives off CN 7, which will give taste sensation on the anterior 2/3 
arch 3 
- copula - midline bump that is seen more posterior - contribution to the posterior 1/3 of tongue 
- which will have palaine tonsils + foramen cecum + 
- CN 9 - general sensation AND taste sensaton 
arch 4 
- extreme posterior part + epiglottis
- CN X - for both Sensory and taste 
muscle - 
- from mesoderm from occipital somite myoblasts
- CN 12 all except **palatoglossus, which is CN x**



malformations
1. macroglossia - large tongue 
2. microglossia - small tongue 
3. ankyloglossia - tongue-tie; restricted movement bc **incomplete regression of frenulum during development**
	1. speech impairment 

first arch syndrome -
1. **pierre robin sequence**
	1. maldev of 1st pharyngeal arch = note that the 
	2. **arch = maxillary mandibular prominences develop, 
		first cleft develops as the ear canal
		1st pouch makes the auditory tube!**
	3. micrognathia - underdevelopped mandible (arch)
	4. glossoptosis - posterior displacement of the tongue, the palatine plates and stuff would be placed too far back, from the ceiling in the medial area downwards... so cleft palate is made 
		1. short mandible -> displace big tongue posterirly 
		2. **palatal shelves can't fuse**
		3. cleft palate!
	5. ear anomales due to the cleft + pouch 
	6. feeding + breathing difficulties, middle ear dysfunction as recurrent ottitis media 
2. treacher collins syndrome - more serious 
	1. mandibular hypoplasia - or jsut not develop 
	2. cleft palate due to disrupted facial function 
	3. **zygomatic bone underdevelopment with flattened cheekbones**
	4. external ear malformations - absent pinnae?
	5. lower eyelid colobomas - **notches + gaps in eyelid tissue = wiith displacement of zygomatic bones**
	6. more serious - airway obstruction, feeding hard, hearing loss structurally , and req lots of care
	7. often inivolve the TCOF1 gene chrom 5 

lateral cysts, sinuses, fistulas - persistnt pharyngeal grooves aka clefts? 
- especially with the cervical sinus formed by 2-4 grooves, which coalesce and meant to disappear 
- would be fistulas lateral on neck near Sternocleidomastoid muscle
	- branchial cleft cyst - fluid filled, non-communicating
	- bracbranchialhial sinus - open tract to skin or pharynx
	- branchial fistula - complete tract there 
	- needs surgical excision + risk of infection 


thyroglossal duct remnants - seen in the **middle of neck as a cyst**
- if they swallow or stick out their tongue it moves! 
- thyroid gland would leave that duct there 
- thyroid primordium would originate at foramen cecum, then migrates, and then leaves that thyroglossal duct 
- ectopic thyroid tissue can happen anywhere along that path 
	- base of tongue, hyoid bone, midline neck 
	- sometimes kids have trouble swallowing + can't speak at back of tongue 
- key thing - we need to confirm normal thyroid presence be4 removal - maybe they're missing that only one. 

pharyngeal pouches - ectopic **parathyroid + thymic tissue**
- they can get stuck or go further down , so all that can be in weird locations 
- thymic tissue from 3rd pharyngeal pouch, and go all the way down. but some will remain, making accessory thymic tissue + accessory tissue
- thyroid tissue from the 4th pouch 
- commono sites - along the thyroid descent path + mediastinum + aortic arch 
- usually asymmetric

1. digeorge syndrome
	1. NCCs - deficient, so they don't migrate where they are suppoed to therefore - **impaired dev of 3rd + 4th pharyngeal pouches**
	2. so duh thymic hypoplasia + hypoparathyroidism 
	3. immune response nerved by a ton, 
	4. **TBX1 gene mutations**; part of the 22nd chromosomes etc. 
	5. cleft palate, micrognatha, small mouthm, smooth philtrum, nasal bridge + posteriorly rotated ears
	6. **persistent truncus arteriosus PTA**
- **huge diff = this is the one that causes immune deficiency!!!**


1. CHARGE syndrome - affects NCC migration + craniofacia dev
	1. CHD7 gene
	2. smilar to digeorge 
	3. Coloboma of eye - missing tissue of eye - or a hole 
	4. Heart defects - tetralogy of fallot 
	5. Atresa of choanae - blocking of nasal 
	6. Retardtion of growth/dev 
	7. Genital anomalies liek hypogonadism 
	8. Ear abnormaliities like deafness
