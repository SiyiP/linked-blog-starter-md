#HEENT #bugs 

case 1 
- suddenly at 9 - progressive neuro deterioraton 
- unilateral paresis of upper limb 
- walking difficulties, then aphasia, lethargy, abnormal movements + tremors observed
- 5 mon later freq generalized tonic clonic seizures + falls 
- given carbamazepine - helped a lot but then 2 months wore off 

persistent viral infection. - it stays in host after acute symptmos ended
recall - CNS is immune privileged so things can hide there easily 
how do things persist
- infection of host is not cytolytic - lacks transcription factors for cytolytic replication .... 
	- they're well differentiated like neurons or microglia 
- viral genome maintained 
	- DNA + retroviruses integrate into genome 
	- episome - using plasmid thing via DNA viruses 
	- unknown mech - RNA viruses 
- evasion from immune system 
	- CNS is immune privileged 
	- antigenic variation + virokines - thru maybe even losing genes to proteins 

viral agents in progessive neuro dz 
conventional agents - measles, rubella, JC polyoma virus, AIDS, enteroviruses 
- they have nucleic acid genome
- protein capsids
- grow in cultures
- persist via infection of nonpermissive cells, mutations that reduce antigenicity or other, mutations that resist norm replication 

unconventional = genome req for persistence doesn't apply 
- prions - dont have a genome 


etiologic agents - all of these use the abbreviation lol 

subacute sclerosing panencephalitis SSPE - preventable but no curative therapy 
- measles virus agent 
- lethal gneralized demyelinating inflammatino caused by wild type strain of measles
- measles viruses are spontaneous mutants, missing gene for proteins 
- absence of structural proteins - **prevents host cell lysis + limits recognition...**
- infection limited to brain + retina = only in CNS 
- 8-11 yo males, and ppl who get measles be4 2 years old 
	- stage 1 dementia = personality changes  
	- 2 epilepsy = myoclonus, autonomic dysfunction 
	- stage 3 decerebration = spasticity, extrapyramidal symptoms 
	- stage 4 vegetative state = autonomic failure 
- DX: electroencephalography - 
	- paroxymal delta waves + periodic sharp + slow wave complexes. 
	- **CSF!!!! high IgG anti-measles antibodies duh**
- death in 1-3 yrs 
- TREAT: transiently improve with antiepileptics 

progressive rubella panencephalitis- preventable but no curative 
- rubella virus - recall that deficits are born in congenital rubella.
	- congenital can have late onset ocular manifestations like retinopathy, cataracts, corneal degen but not fatal 
- age onset 8-19 years 
- PRPE similar to SSPE sypmtom-wise
- DX: IgG in CSF specific for rubella or virus in brain 
- this is fatal  

progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy - treatable , restore immune function but not curative. 
- JC polyomavirus 
- reactivation of this latent/persistent JC 
- lesions in the white matter of the brain ... almost all pts have underlying immunodeficiency like malignancis, HIV, transplants, etc. 
- visual deficiets - hemianopia common 
- mental impairment
- weakness
- ataxia
- seizures = least common but still there 
- DX: consider if they're immunosuppress
	- serology useless most ppl have this endemic virus
	- MRI!!!! **multiple nonsymmetric lesions of demylinization in white matter**
	- CSF = **poz pcr detection - high spec, lower sensitivity, only dx in combo with clinical symptoms**
	- seen in **brain biopsy enlarged astrocytes + oligodendrocytes with abnormal nuclei**
		- icosahedral virus particles in these nuclei 
- TREAT: rapid reversal of immunosuprression can slow progression ... not reversible. median survival 3.5 months 

HIV associated neurocognitive disorder - HAND; anti-retroviral cure 
- HIV 
- neurocog impairment in pts with HIV **cannot be atributed to another cause**
- this is result of a combo of dissemination of hiv in the cns + resultnt immune activation 
- common even in ppl with well-controlled hIV
- mild attention mpairment, exec function and recall
- advanced - can have dementia - considered an AIDs-defining condition 
	- subcortical dementia - mem loss, depression, movement disorders, apathy/behavioral changes
	- altered mental state, gait disturbances
	- more common in ppl with untreated HIV 
	- elderly HIV patients now commonly dvelop other types of dementia unlike this one luckily due to antiretroviral treatment 
- DX: rule out everything else - 
	- CT MRI with diffus cerebral atrophy, patchy symmetrical changes in deep white matter. 
	- rule out dementia with B12 folate and TSH levels 
- TREAT: antiretroviral therapy and avoid efavirenz 

persistent enterovirus infection - treatable ; serotype specific anti-enterovirus immune globulin 
- enterovirus ; replication in CNS 
- happens to the immunodeficient **only in ppl with severe or congenital acquired humoral immunodifficiencly like agammaglobulinemia at highest risk**
- headache confusino, lethargy, seizures, and CSF pleocytosis common 
- TREAT: noncurative but human hyperimmune globulin to infecting virus type... relapse when therapy discontinued 

unconventional persistent viral agent - prions - 
- can't be culture 
- imune def cant alter course 
- pathology **always progressive**
- folded endogenous protein from immune privileged tissue 
- **each cns prion dz medated by PRNP host gene**
- PrPc normal (helices, no aggregation) -> PrPSc (will be in **beta sheets, PK resistance**) - will pathogenically polyermized into toxic aggregates 
- PRNP codon - encode either methionine or valine 
	- **homozygosity of EITHER = higher risk**
	- heterozygosity MV is protective 
	- TSE = transmissible spongiform encephalopathies 
		- infectious - tissue in human, saliva in animals; we can transmit the dz via injection regardles of the original form of transmission 
		- familial - mutation in PrPc gene
		- sporadic - 85% of cases
- replcatioon - when normal cellular protein comes in contact with pathogenic protein aggregate 
- all are uniformly fatal once symptomatic 
- all the things below are prions 
- most reliable way to prove prions have been inactivated = bioassay in animals. this is **how nosocomial transmission happens via med procedures!!! any type of surgrery happens!! optic ones highest risk**

spongiform encephalopathies - they're vacuolar changes in cortex.+cerebellum 
- like songey brain tissue from neuronal loss + astrocyte proliferation 
- incubation months to decates
- lymphoreticular system involved in replication 

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">crueztfeld-jakob dz - infection control awareness ; CJD</mark>
- ppl in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">50/60s </mark>
- seen as psych disorder then rapid progression; forgetful/disoriented, dementia, gait changes, inc muscle tone, invol movements, seizures 
- **time to death is 4-7 months** 
- 8<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">5% sporadi</mark>c, remainder familial/nosocomial 
- no recorded transmission via personal contact or resp route 
- blood transfusion or sex. nosocomial cases 3-20 years 
- DX: biopsy/autopsy gold standard but hazardous ): 
	- **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">spongiform</mark> degeneration in brain biopsy!!! and gliosis**
	- lab dx - neuron specific enolase, S100 protein, tau , and 14-3-3 protein inc 
	- **RT-QUIC - real time we look for sporadic shaking CSF with it!!! only done in one lab here.**
	- EEG - triphasic periodic sharp wave complexes with freq of 1-2 hz 
	- MRIs: hyperintensity in basal ganglia, insular cortices, frontal cortices

variant crueztfeld-jakob dz-  infection control awareness 
- bovine spongiform encephalopathy - thru neural tissue/bone marrow consumption of diseased cattle 
- stopped it - bone meal from sheep to cow 
- cookng doesn't destroy them so nosocomial transmission occurs via autoclaving happens 
- mostly younger, lasting longer + mistaken for psych problems at first 
- no therapy 
- death in 14 mon 

gerstmann-straussler-scheinker dz-  infection control awareness 
- similar to crueztfeld-jakob dz
- younger ages 30-40 
- develops even more slowly than the crueztfeld-jakob dz, in 5 years death instead of months 
- dementia less common but cerebellar ataxia, nystagmus, paralysis all common 
- 99% familial - autosomal dom **mutation of PRNP gene!!!**
	- vertical transmission/nherited susceptibility 
	- DX: fmhx/sequencing 
- no effecive therapy 

fatal familial insomnia -  infection control awareness 
- intractible insomnia, sympathetic overreactvity, dementia 
- 100% familial 
- death in 1-2 years, age onset 35-60 wide 
- PrPc - protease resistant form 
- DX: fam hx + brain biospy
