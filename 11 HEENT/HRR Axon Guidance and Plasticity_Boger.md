structure + action of growth cones
 - these are the driving forc for the axon growth 
 - 2 prom structures
 - lamellipodium - a sheetlike expansion of growing axon at tip , has some receptors to id stuff outside 
	 - F-actin cytoskeleton regulates the change here + filopodial shape 
	 - microtubule - tubulin - stabilizes + helps more cytoskeleton construct 
 - filopodia - small processes that extend from the lamellipodia - will show and direct it where to go 
- attractive cues - in the environment which tell it to grow towards
- repelltive cues too on the outside 

signals for guidance
- chemoattraction targeted derived signals -> influence axonal growth cones - attracting them to approproiate destintions 
	- tropic vs trophic 
		- tropic - helps with guiding and developping
		- trophic - pH molecules which help **synaptic development to connect that axon to target once it's set up** - config change . and pH stays longer. 
	- netrins - direct axonal growht across midline 
		- these **direct axons to go across the midline. seen in the comissural factors, ALS, DCML too crossing midline!**
	- calcium - the main driver of this growth/development - with time, a brighter signal in imgs, we see ca+ 
- chemorepellent - to discourage growth 
	- slit - **prevent the axon from crossing back over midline once it's made to cross**
	- robo - 
	- semaphorins - 
		- will see axon retraction. in culture work to see how this grows. 

synaptic connections 
- once it gets there we need to make pre + post synaptic cues. 
- guide posts mak that view nad zone for NT release
- clusters togher postsynaptic re
