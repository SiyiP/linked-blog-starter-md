structure + action of growth cones
 - these are the driving forc for the axon growth 
 - 2 prom structures
 - lamellipodium - a sheetlike expansion of growing axon at tip , has some receptors to id stuff outside 
	 - F-actin cytoskeleton regulates the change here + filopodial shape 
	 - microtubule - tubulin - stabilizes + helps more cytoskeleton construct 
 - filopodia - small processes that extend from the lamellipodia - will show and direct it where to go 
- attractive cues - in the environment which tell it to grow towards
- repelltive cues too on the outside 

signals for guidance
- chemoattraction targeted derived signals -> influence axonal growth cones - attracting them to approproiate destintions 
	- tropic vs trophic 
		- tropic - helps with guiding and developping
		- trophic - pH molecules which help **synaptic development to connect that axon to target once it's set up** - config change . and pH stays longer. 
	- netrins - direct axonal growht across midline 
		- these **direct axons to go across the midline. seen in the comissural factors, ALS, DCML too crossing midline!**
	- calcium - the main driver of this growth/development - with time, a brighter signal in imgs, we see ca+ 
- chemorepellent - to discourage growth 
	- slit - **prevent the axon from crossing back over midline once it's made to cross**
	- robo - 
	- semaphorins - 
		- will see axon retraction. in culture work to see how this grows. 

synaptic connections 
- once it gets there we need to make pre + post synaptic cues. 
- guide posts mak that view nad zone for NT release
- clusters together postsynaptic receptors in the post-synaptic densitty -  something that's huge to work on in tis . 

topographic maps
chemoaffinity hypothesis. - target is admitting chems to drive that growth? pheromones - are eleased in animals - in frogs for example its seen 
- mapping in the frog with wheere information would cross too. 
- uncrossing of optic nerve fibers = following by nerve **regeneration leads to visuomotor defects**

neurotrophic factors - help aid in this outgrowht - hte 
- NGF - nerve growth factor
- limited to neurons
- regulate diff, growth + survival - don't really use it but ik i was a baby once. 
- you eventually see an plateau at a certain condition of ngf. seeing it promotes cellular outgrowht 

neurotrophins - growth/trophic factors - not all have that same effect 
- brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF
- NT-3
- NT-4/5 
- ciilary neurotrophic facotr
- leukemia inhibitry factor 
in NGF- huge for that teachers. 
bdnf - not much  effect on sympathetics 
binds to he **trk receptors.. specific type of tyrosine kinase receptor that it would activate cell support and aid it**
- can help ppl and survive. 
- Cons: trk receptors go dwn with aging . some rec3ptors will disappaer
- **p75 receptor = would also die by age. ): **

critical neurodevelopment 
- baby talk - when they come tu, emphasize important perceptual distinctions 
- babble - speech like from hearing us 
- childhood lang deprivation. vs adutlt lang deprivation 
- phenomes - **difff speech elemnts making spoken word**
- if the kid can't communication. + is just tucked away - doesn't develop those skills.hard to do it in the future if you miss this critical period. 
	- advantage - they can learn 
more focal regions in **frontal lobe - ** kids are more lit up 
for language in adults it's more of our occipital lobe 

visual dev 
- CNS plasticity - suture 1 eye of anima model during the critical period 
- amblyopia seen - loss of acuity 
- this is a result in humns from strabismus which isn't controlled since childhood
	- esotropia - cross eyed
	- exotropia - divergent strabismus 
	- cataracts + opaque lens 
use or lose it 


hebb's postulate - the neurons that fire together wire together - also use or lose it 
- those that fire togeteher and map automatically firing all the time will live 
- those not mapped - will die of

activity-dependnt plasticity - 
- impact the cell body - greater **ca influx** for more transcription. + more translation 
- happens at dendritic levels, where u can use ndma receptors - sallows for ampa receptors which have been pie and now long what now . 
long term potentiation - long term on it 


3 types of repair - in the periphery 
1. regrowth of axon - can have severed axon 
2. restoration of dmg'd nerve cells + glial scarring if dmg'd
3. whole cell genesis of new neurons to replace - limited like with olfacotry systems 

peripheral nerve regen - 
- henry head transected peripheral nerve + regen 
	- diffrence in sensation returns!! also not localized
	- set of sensations are more less ... 
	- note - it will not be the same as a regular bakc to baseline even after recovery 

- completly severed axons - with the schwann cells making it guide 
- crush axon - greater recovrery over more time 

glial response - 
with cell injury and responses. - growth factor stuff tooo 
- glial scaring = reactive glia 
- growht factor secrtion 

adult neurogeneiss 
- new nerve cells - olfactory, hippocampus, taste transducer 
new nerve cells can grow in olfctory bulb _ granule and periglomerular cells_ + those in the dentate gyrus
