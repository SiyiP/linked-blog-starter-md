in the first hour posterior triangle is the area 

neck has cervical vertebrae, muscles, viscera (include parathyroid + thyroid gland)
- 4 longitudinal compartments
- 2 major trigangles 
the sternocleiomastoid will separate the triangles 

skeleton of neck 
- 7 C 
- hyoid bone - no articulations, floating, ligaments and muscles
	- this is a horseshoe that is an anterior body , has 2 horns. 
	- no articulation with any bones
	- but has a position that is very stable bc many ligaments + muscles
- clavicles - 
- menubrium + 1st rib 
- cartilaginous structures
- and the region j superior to that = root of neck. 
- thyroid cartilages anterior to the cervical vertebrae
- inferior to thyroid cartilages (2 laminae that come together anteriorly at an angle known as the anterior laryngeal prominence)
- cricoid = circular, anterior is not as steep as the posterior one 
- tracheal rings = horseshoe shapd cartilage is smaller and inferior to all the cricoid 

palpate these landmarks for physex
- lower border of mandible / jaw
- hyoid bone - where the jaw meets the neck 
- laryngeal prominence of thyroid cartilage - running down midline 
- cricoid cartilage - the divot where it would be , below the laryngeal prominence
- sternal end of clavicle 
posterior palpate
- external occipital protuberance
- mastoid process behind ears 
- transverse process to atlas - down slightly and beheath the earlobe... C1 location 
- just anterior to the transverse process to atlas  - angle of mandible 
- sternocleidomastoid - this is the key to neck , rotation makes ur neck pop out 

palpable superficial landmarks inferior to mandible 
- hyoid bone  - C3 
- laryngeal prominence of thyroid cartilage (made up of thyroid lamina coming together at that prominence) - C4 , where common carotid a will bifurcate
	- in between will go into the airway 
	- you must stick the tube or something in emergency to access that airway. so you want to not injure the vocal folds. 
- cricoid cartilage - will have retinoid caritlages that attach to vocal folds  , C6 level 
	- at this level, we see pharynx ends , esophagus begins, trachea begin. 
	- pharynx gets food and air and then it separates at C6 into airway + esophagus 
	- middle cervical sympathetic ganglion is here, where inferior thyroid artery passs up and over, mixing with the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and the isthmus of thyroid gland is there
		-  **note if you cut it during surgery - recurrent laryngeal nerve - you will have dead or dmg'd vocal fold on that side.**
- tracheal rings - the isthmus of the thyroid glands will cover these 2-4 rings. T2-3 level

at and below C6 = we see esophagus and trachea 
anteriorly there's a muscle in subcutaneous fascia , 
and invested into deep fascia. 
investing fascia will surround the whole neck 
- this fascia will come to enclose the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid, covering that posterior + anterior triangle. 
- also splits to enclose some muscles that attach/insert on hyoid bone 
- inside - additional fascia - prevertebral , muscles and lateral muscles (scalenes), annd deep msucles of the back
- prevertebral fascia make that vertebral compartments. 
- the nerves that will eventually go out to innervate stuff **emerge in this vertebral compartment region, which will then go between the anterior and middle scalene**
	- these are roots + trunk of the BP, making the axillary sheath .

i also forced myself to face my sexuality around a time i had a massive crush, which i shortly learned it would never happen. crushing and falling in love with people is so rare, so when it doesn't work out, or you're in a limbo of desperation and always thinking about one motherfucker all the time it is kinda excruciating. i only got to survive once i went a little outside my own body and told myself that this happens to everyone. same shit for breakups. i'm not a failure or im not unloveable this is just what happens

it's hard to give advice to someone i know when they're going through it all, cuz i know the feeling way too damn much. it feels like there's nothing that can be helped

anyway, i love that i've had people tell me it feels like i'm "normalizing" being very open about your sexuality. it's fun to be you and to be surrounded with people who fuck with YOU!!!! labels aren't important, and i think people do spend a lot of time stressing over which once best suits them, but i understand how it can be easier to understand yourself when you have a group of people to latch on to

had a few people come up to me at twitchcon to say the same thing, and it was a very full-circle moment. i didn't feel like myself up until i shared who i was to twitter, and on stream. i just kept repeating "im gay" over and over cuz idgaf if people think that's my only personality!! it's fun to be able to scream to the masses what was once a kinda shameful part of myself


prezoh - placing importance on whether my looks match what you personally find attractive is demonic and you should just watch porn or something. i look different from three years ago because i don't present myself to maximize my fuckability according to gooners, or people obsessed with skinniness or youth
