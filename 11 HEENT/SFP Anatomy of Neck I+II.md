#anatomy #H

in the first hour posterior triangle is the area 

neck has cervical vertebrae, muscles, viscera (include parathyroid + thyroid gland)
- 4 longitudinal compartments
- 2 major trigangles 
the sternocleiomastoid will separate the triangles 

skeleton of neck 
- 7 C 
- hyoid bone - no articulations, floating, ligaments and muscles
	- this is a horseshoe that is an anterior body , has 2 horns. 
	- no articulation with any bones
	- but has a position that is very stable bc many ligaments + muscles
- clavicles - 
- menubrium + 1st rib 
- cartilaginous structures
- and the region j superior to that = root of neck. 
- thyroid cartilages anterior to the cervical vertebrae
- inferior to thyroid cartilages (2 laminae that come together anteriorly at an angle known as the anterior laryngeal prominence)
- cricoid = circular, anterior is not as steep as the posterior one 
- tracheal rings = horseshoe shapd cartilage is smaller and inferior to all the cricoid 

palpate these landmarks for physex
- lower border of mandible / jaw
- hyoid bone - where the jaw meets the neck 
- laryngeal prominence of thyroid cartilage - running down midline 
- cricoid cartilage - the divot where it would be , below the laryngeal prominence
- sternal end of clavicle 
posterior palpate
- external occipital protuberance
- mastoid process behind ears 
- transverse process to atlas - down slightly and beheath the earlobe... C1 location 
- just anterior to the transverse process to atlas  - angle of mandible 
- sternocleidomastoid - this is the key to neck , rotation makes ur neck pop out 

palpable superficial landmarks inferior to mandible 
- hyoid bone  - C3 
- laryngeal prominence of thyroid cartilage (made up of thyroid lamina coming together at that prominence) - C4 , where common carotid a will bifurcate
	- in between will go into the airway 
	- you must stick the tube or something in emergency to access that airway. so you want to not injure the vocal folds. 
- cricoid cartilage - will have retinoid caritlages that attach to vocal folds  , C6 level 
	- at this level, we see pharynx ends , esophagus begins, trachea begin. 
	- pharynx gets food and air and then it separates at C6 into airway + esophagus 
	- middle cervical sympathetic ganglion is here, where inferior thyroid artery passs up and over, mixing with the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and the isthmus of thyroid gland is there
		-  **note if you cut it during surgery - recurrent laryngeal nerve - you will have dead or dmg'd vocal fold on that side.**
- tracheal rings - the isthmus of the thyroid glands will cover these 2-4 rings. T2-3 level

at and below C6 = we see esophagus and trachea 
anteriorly there's a muscle in subcutaneous fascia , 
and invested into deep fascia. 
investing fascia will surround the whole neck 
- this fascia will come to enclose the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid, covering that posterior + anterior triangle. 
- also splits to enclose some muscles that attach/insert on hyoid bone 
- inside - additional fascia - prevertebral , muscles and lateral muscles (scalenes), annd deep msucles of the back
- prevertebral fascia make that vertebral compartments. 
- the nerves that will eventually go out to innervate stuff **emerge in this vertebral compartment region, which will then go between the anterior and middle scalene**
	- these are roots + trunk of the BP, making the axillary sheath . 

![[deep cervical fascia compartments.png]]
2 vascular copmartments holding the internal jugular v thruout the entire length of it 
above C4 (common carotid bifurcation)
- internal carotid is in the vascular comapartment - **external carotid is not in the vascular compartment**
- vagus nerve is part of the carotid sheath 
- vascular compartment - which **contains the carotid sheath**
	- internal jugualr vein + vagus n from entire distance
	- inf to C4, common carotid a 
	- superior ot C4 = interal carotid a
	- carotid system 
		- either way common carotid is from the **level of sternoclavicular joint**
		- common carotid a from the **right comes from brachiocephalic trunk**
		- common carotid a from the **left is from arch of aorta**
		- as it ascends in the sheath, it will be crossed by omohyoid tendon, and then bifurcates at C4, external and internal carotid
			- external carotid will leave the sheath , major supplier 
			- external carotid branches will come off below the posterior digastric belly? -> basically descends into that carotid triangle 
				- 8 brs in total : 
					- superior thyroid - first br coming out , tiny br to the **thyroid gland**
					- ascending pharyngeal - ascends to give msucles along pharynx , same level just more posterior
					- lingual  - artery go deep to the digastric belly, supplies oral cavity floor 
					- facial - goes deep to digastric muscle, wrapping around the jaw, and crosses over the jaw into the facial msucles , making a little groove. 
						- sometimes the lingual + facial comes from a common stem off the external... 
					- occipital - posterior to the facial - ascends deep to posterior digastric, wrapping around to the occipital region 
					- posterior auricular - ascends superior to stylohyoid muscle
						- giving rise to postrior auricular artery 
					- superfcal temporal - terminal br, going into the scalp 
					- maxillary - infratemporal region
		-  **as it bifurcates - we see the dilated portion carotid sinus in the carotid triangle, at C4** = a baroreceptor measuring the BP
![[arteries of neck.png]]

internal jugular vein 
- in the sheath ultmately joinign subclavian to make **brachiocephalic v**
![[veins and sinuses of skull.png]]
- recall its making a whole lot of sinuses , coming out of the skull + are formed, sigmoid sinus will go down joined by another sinus making the internal jugular vein leaving the jugular foramen
- superficial temporal vein - joined by the maxilary vein making that retromandibular vein 
	- has post + ant division
	- joined by posterior auricular -> external jugular 
	- anterior division -> joined by common facial v draining into the internal jugular v 
	- superior + middle thyroid vein + common vfascial will join into the internal jugular v 
	-
-  along the **neck path of internal jugular = lymph nodes are there, deep cervical lymph nodes collecting from the skull AND superficial lymph nodes (along the external jugular v)**
- then the lymph either joins the thoracic duct or goes into the brachiocephalic vein independently 
- superficial cervical nodes. - skin of neck -> external jugular vein 
- regional nodes submandibular node,s parotid nodes, mastoid nodes + occipital nodes , all drain down to the deep cervical nodes. 
- deep nodes drain via jugular trunks to venous system 


fascial spaces - the numbered regions - 1, 2, 3 
- pretracheal space, retropharyngeal , and prevertebral 
- pretracheal - sontinuoous into the thorax, to the superior mediastinum + anterior mediastinum 
	- - so if you have a thyroid elargement or tumor it'll move down to the heart. and 
	- similarly if you have an issue with mediastinum it can move up to the neck. 
- retropharyngeal = posterior mediastinum 
	-  infection spread is huge here 
- prevertebral= posterior mediastnum , but all the way down to diaphragm 
	- infection spread is huge here 

skin + platysma 
- muscle of fascial expression, innervation by facial nerve 
- innervated by cervical br of facial n CN 7 
- we will see the lower portion of carotid gland there too, lowest br cervical branch 
ppl as they age get bands in their neck - the remnants of platysma just fyi 

cutaneous innervation of HEENT
![[cutaneous nn of scalp.png]]

- dermatomes are C2, and then at middle of neck = C3, and then at the root or base of neck more down it's C4!!! 
- posteriorly. these nerves are coming from the dorsal rami 
- and ventral rami + the cervical plexus who is made by the ventral rami supply the front. 

sensory branches all emerge from at the sternocleidomastoid on top of it, for the posterior triangle - they all come from the same or similar points, outside the deep fascia. 
- lesser occipital n - ascending to behind the ear 
- greater occipital nerve 
- great auricular - straight to the ear lobe 
- transverse cervical - crosses anterior aspect of neck 
- supraclavicular n - drapes over the clavicle 
nerves of these are from cervical plexus !!
- note the spinal accessory nerve from the skull will run deep to SCM and crosses posterior triangle. 
any of the cervical plexus nerves from C5 and below -> emerge between anterior + middle scalene. 
**superiorly C1-> 4 = emerge anterior to the middle scalene , not sandwiched.** 

muscular floor of the posterior triangle 
- splenius capitis
- levator scapulae
- scalene muscles (3 of thm, posterior, middle, and anterior)
- omohyooid from scapular notch with 2 heads and intermeddiate tendon deep to SCM 
	- makes the subclavian triangle with the SCM and the clavicle . - **if you apply compression you block the subclavian vessels.**

they are all closely associated with the external jugular vein, piercing the deep fascia at the SCM lateral edge 
- anterior jugular vein tributaries get here under the chin, disappearing into SCM, and then the communicating br to the external jugular. 

![[superficial neck veins.png]]
- posterior division + posterior auricular will make the 
- retromandibular v divides -> ant/post division 
	- post division of retromandibular + posteiror auricular will make external jugular v 
	- this will pierce deep fascia, joining subclavian v 
- anterior jugular will drain into external jugular 
- fasical vein + retromandibular anterior division -> common facial vein -> deep internal jugular vein - if we have heart related issues - **external jugular vein will dilate CVP!!!**

things deep to platysma
 - motor nn - cervical + marginal mandibular br of 7
 - cutnaeous nerves = transverse cervical nn, great auricular, supraclavicular 
 - veins - ant + external jugular veins

posterior tri
- bt SCM posterior edge and anterior edge of trapezius m 
- anterior triangle - bt SCM 

SCM muscle
- from 2 heads
	- from manubrium 
	- other one from medial 1/3 clavicle 
- will both insert onto the mastoid process + nuchal line 
- CN 11 supplies it; the accessory n 
- tilds the head to the shoulder of same side. rotates head toward opposite side. 

2 prevertebral muscles
- longus capitus 
	- from occipital bone -> C3-C6 transverse processes
	- action for both - flex head. + neck _> **rotation!_**
	- nerve supply - ventral primary rami of cervical nn
- longus coli - from C5->T3 bodies, and insertion into the C3-C5 transverse process  coming up 

scalene muscles - from side 
anterior 
- from C3-6 trans processes -> 1st rib 
middle 
- c1-6 trans processes -> 1st rib, posterior to the anterior scalene. ; broader origin , 
posterior 
- from lower cervical vert, trans processes -> 2nd rib ; 
- they all rotate and flex neck, nerve supply - VPR of cervical nerves 

VPR of cervical nerves 
- note - C5 and below which make the cervical plexus emerge between anterior + middle scalene 
- C1+2+3 + 4 come out and simply run down restng on the middle scalene 

cervical plexus \
![[cervical plexus.png|484x356]]
loops formed between 1+2, 2+3, and 3+4 - not named
hypoglossal - CNXII close to C1. 
spinal accessory nerve crossses that posterior triangle 
C1  makes circle and also **hikes with the hypoglossal nerve**
- they **leave the hypoglossal nerve - to make a loop called the ansa cervicalis**
- ansa cervicalis - will loop over the carotid sheath 
- other C1 fibers continue + leave the hypoglossal nerve making nerves to the hyoid (genio and thyrohyoid )
- C3 +2 will complete the ansa cervicalis 
	- these will go on to the sternothyroid, sternohyoid, omohyoid 
phrenic nerve, C3,4,5 -> descends **on the anterior scalene muscle**
- pinneed down to the anterior scalene via **transverse cervical + suprascapular a**
C2,C3 loop = making most of the sensory branches. 
- C3+4 -> loop of the supraclavicular n descending 
- C2-4 = are all giving proprioceptive fibers from the CN IX accessory n 

brachial plexus + subclavian arteries
- basically that **anterior scalene muscle** separates subclavian vein (more anterior) from subclavian a 
- first part of subclavian a - medial of the anterior scalene muscle, having the thyrocervical trunk -> which gives out that transverse cervical a and subclavian artery eventually

anterior cervical triangle = points apex **inferiorly instead!**
bounds - 
- posteriorly, SCM m 
- superiorly - inf border of **mandible**
- anterior = **midline of neck**
- apex = the jugular notch of manubrium
have to reflect the SCM
- looks like there's curtains near midline - the infrahyoid muscles
visceral compartment = larynx, esophagus, trachea, glands
- see carotid sheath - common carotid a, int jugular vein and internal carotid a 

subdivisions of anterior triangle- bounds divided by muscles, 
- muscles - supahyoid mm, infrahyoid mm - they all ascend to insert on that bone 
- suprahyoid mm (4)- > elevate hyoid bone 
	- mylohoid - origin from myohyoid lines (interior aspect of mandible)
		- from the mylohyoid line from inner mandible 
		- makes a seam fuses together near midline, making an upside down tent supporting oral cavity 
		- insertion into body of hyoid + fibers of muscle on opposite side 
		- nerve to mylohyoid is from CNV3 
	- stylohoid m - from styloid process of hyoid 
		- insertion to body + greater horn of hyoid 
		- **pierced by tendon of digastric muscle, running thru it**
		- innvervation by nerve to stylohoid from CN 7 
	- geniohyoid m - from genial tubercle of anterior inferior mandible 
	- digastric m - 2 bellies, one from mastoid process, other from mandible + intermediate tendon bound to hyoid bone
		- posterior belly from mastoid process -> interediate tendon which pierces stylohoid 
			- nerve to stylohyoid CN7 
		- anterir belly from lower mandible and then to intermediate tendon 
			- since it's sitting on mylohyoid it's innervated by nerve to mylohyoid CN 5  
		- intermediate tendon - **tied to hyoid with loop of fascia**
		- we make a submandibular AKA digastric triangle - with the mandible + anterior + posterior bellies of digastric m 
			- submandibular glands in this area too 
		- submental triangle - the medial most border of the anterio belly of digastric m + midline + hyoid bone - 
- infrahyoid msucles - 4 - make a **strap**
	- omohyoid m from superior scapula border
		- superior belly -> from intermediate tendon up to the hyoid bone 
		- inferior belly -> runs from **below the clavicle** to the intermediate tendon 
			- ansa cervicalis supplies these 2 
	- sternohyoid m - attach to the - longest from internal surface of menubrium to the lower surface of hyoid bones
		- in bt these two, the pretracheal fascia is there 
		- nerve - C1,2,3 = ansa cervicalis branches 
	- sternothyroid m - attach to the thyroid? - under sternohyoid 
		- from interior aspect of sternum , from the posterior surface of manubrium -> oblique line of lamina of thyroid cartilage
		- Ansa cervicalis 
		- this muscle makes **pockets where the thyroid gland can insert into, they can't extend further than this so it limits its extension superiorly**
	- tyrohyoid m - under sternohyoid 
		- from the oblique line of thyroid lamina insertion into lower border of hyoid bone 
		- n<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">erve to thyrohyoid - c1 travelling on hypoglossal CN 12 </mark>

carotid triangle 
- inferiorly formed by anterior border of SCM, 
- superiorly the posterior belly of digastric
- anteriorly superior belly of omohyoid 
- this is where you feel that carotid pulse, so you can press vessels against the cervical vertebae processes. 
	- inside the vascular structures of this area:
	- hypoglossa n swinging down, X branches are inside, and accessory nerve descending too 
	- making ansa cervicalis right under... 
muscular triangle - forget about it :P 

vagus nerve X 
- leaves thru jugular foramen to exit out of skull -
- only this one out of the rest of the CNs exiting from jugular foramen - stay in the sheath - out of 9,10,11 
- X travels thru neck , posterior to vessels, and somewhat in between artery supply of internal + common carotid + internal carotid v 
	- **gives offf superior laryngeal nerve leaving the sheath**, which splits: 
		- internal laryngeal n - sensation to laynx down to vocal fold levels
		- external laryngeal - innervates cricothyoid muscle to tense the vocal folds, traveling with the superior thyroid artery, so this is dangerous to look out for in thyroidectomy 
	- pharyngeal nerve
	- recurrent laryngeal n - sensory to all the levels *below* the vocal folds , will operate all the muscles below too - **loss of voice if u dmg this one**

other CN in NECK
1. CN 9 , leaves via jugular foramen , bt internal jugular v + internal carotid a 
	1. deep to the stylohyoid m 
	2. **one thing to recall - sensory brs from carotid sinus + carotid body traveling back to CN9**
2. CN 11 accompanies, structures bt internal jugular v + int carotid a , leaves jugular foramen, and deep to SCM, 
3. CN 12 - hypoglossal canal leaves!! this is medial to internal jugular vein 
	1. will **sweep down and crosses many br of external cartoid artery, the occipital artery, external carotid, and both lingula + facial br going deep to digastric + stylohoid**

visceral compartment of the pretracheal fascial creation 
- thyroid glands have the isthmus covering C2-4 tracheal rings 
- 2 lobes from isthmus will be ascending 
- recall that the thyroid gland ascendence is stopped by the sternothyroid muscles 
	- see the expansion be inferior in case of goiter
- recurrent larygneal br  of vagus - inside that **tracheal esophageal groove,**
- we see sup + inf thyroid aa 

blood supply to thyroid gland
- having superior thyroid a + v = from the **external carotid to the upper portion of thyroid lateral lobes**
- inferior thyroid a = from the thyrocervical trunk, pt 1 of the subclavian 
- thyroid ima = some ppl have a 3rd artery ascending to the area of the isthmus ; not often. 
- superior vein = going nto internal jugular v 
- middle thyroid v =  also going nto internal jugular v ; **there is no artery counterpart- will be on the practical!**
- inferior thyroid veins - drain inferiorly to brachiocephalic veins and might merge into each other. 

inferior thyroid a - cross posterior to carotid sheath 
- to remove the thyroid - 
	- ligate both inf/sup thyroid ar
	- ligate superior thyroid a- **careful of the external laryngeal n**
	- ligate inf thyroid a- carful of it crisscrossing the recurrent laryngeal n 
- 2 glands on each lobe itself embedded
	- superior parathyroid + inferior parathyroid glands. 

parathyroid - never see this, back of trachea, thyroid glands are well-connected, 
- superior parathyroid - on superior pole, posterior of the thryoid 
	- consistent placement - from the 4th brachial pouch embryology - quick lateral trip moves over 
- inferior parathyroid gland - consider it being next to the recurrent laryngeal nerve
	- from the third pouch with the **thymus**- 

not uncommon to see the **inferior parathyroid gland not  where we expect, as far down as the mediastinum!!!**
- the inferior from the third pouch will migrate w the thymus... but **if it sticks with the thymus it will go to the mediastinum/..**


the root of neck - inlet of thorax, above the interior surface of rib1, medial clavicle in that region 
- formation of brachiocephalic veins, 
- thoracic duct running posterior to carotid sheath 
- subclavian v + arteries (separated by anterior scalene muscles
- roots of BP emerging superior to subclavian a 
- part 1 of the subclavian a - branches coming off medial to the anterior scalene muscle 

recall subclavian artery 3 parts
- part 1  - medial to anterior scalene 
	- vertebral a -> ascends in 3 parts
		- pt 1 , cervical portion - from first part of foramen into the transverse process foramen , entering C6 , 
		- pt 2 , vertebral portion - proceeds upwards thru last foramen at C1 in canal 
		- pt 3, - suboccipital part, swings out and then enters skull in **foramen magnum, and intracranial portion, making basilar artery making circle of willis**
		![[vertebral a angiogram.png|240x188]]
	- thyrocervical trunk
		- 2nd br, gives rise to the **transverse cervical a + suprascapular a**
			- will pin the phrenic n against anterior scalene muscle 
		- inf thyroid br will ascend higher than it needs to and then loops back to the thyroid, having relationshps with the recurrent laryngeal n 
	- int thoracic a descends 
- part 2 - DEEP to anterior scalene 
	- costocervical trunk 
- part 3 - lateral to anterior scalene 

brachiocephalic vein - made in the gap bt manubrial + clavicular head of SCM 
- internal jugular v goes down + joinged by subclavian 
- basically a supraclavicular canuula can be used to access this large vein 
- and an infraclavicular appraoch can be used too - 
- supervicial subclavian v is important for ports 


thoracic duct 
- posterior to carotid sheath 
- this will ascend left of esophagus transverse process of C7 
- in the mediastinum, travels to l side -> crossing all the branches of the **first part of the subclavian a**
- and then descends to drain into the brachiocephalic vein !



pathology 
1. torticollis - contraction of cervical muscles producing twisting of neck + slanting of head
	1. see muscular commonly - children congenital
		1. might require PT or surgical intervention 
		2. can be acquired due to infection or trauma
		3. we see fibrous tissue tumor in SCM , injury from birth, or hematoma + fibrotic mass entrappign CN XI, denervating SCM!!
	2. spasmodic 
		1. cervical dystonia , 
		2. happens in adults, might combine with trapezius 
		3. somethings's wrong with the nerve transiently 
		4. sustained malpositioning, and shoulder can be elevate + anteriorly displaced. 
2. subclavian a comprression 
	1. pressure in subclavian triangle 
	2. superior to clavicle, inf/anterior to the inferior belly of omohyoid m
	3. main arterial supply to upper limb 
3. aberrant thyroid tissue = thyroid gland - develops from a downgrowth from a thyroglossal duct 
	1. some ppls thyroid glands fail to move down, having thyroglossal duct, it being below the tongue
	2. other ppl might drop little dips of tissue, whch might be continuous = a **pyramidal lobe**
	3. aberrant thyroid tissue = **always superior to the isthmus, where t's supposed to drop down. diff from thyroid overgrowth**
4. aberrant parathyroid; tumor while its in the mediastinum 
	1. bone breakdown, hgih ca levels
	2. if in embryological dev, the 3rd brachial pouch continues to migrate together down with the thymus 
	3. will be in the mediastinum- we need good imaging

i also forced myself to face my sexuality around a time i had a massive crush, which i shortly learned it would never happen. crushing and falling in love with people is so rare, so when it doesn't work out, or you're in a limbo of desperation and always thinking about one motherfucker all the time it is kinda excruciating. i only got to survive once i went a little outside my own body and told myself that this happens to everyone. same shit for breakups. i'm not a failure or im not unloveable this is just what happens

it's hard to give advice to someone i know when they're going through it all, cuz i know the feeling way too damn much. it feels like there's nothing that can be helped

anyway, i love that i've had people tell me it feels like i'm "normalizing" being very open about your sexuality. it's fun to be you and to be surrounded with people who fuck with YOU!!!! labels aren't important, and i think people do spend a lot of time stressing over which once best suits them, but i understand how it can be easier to understand yourself when you have a group of people to latch on to

had a few people come up to me at twitchcon to say the same thing, and it was a very full-circle moment. i didn't feel like myself up until i shared who i was to twitter, and on stream. i just kept repeating "im gay" over and over cuz idgaf if people think that's my only personality!! it's fun to be able to scream to the masses what was once a kinda shameful part of myself


prezoh - placing importance on whether my looks match what you personally find attractive is demonic and you should just watch porn or something. i look different from three years ago because i don't present myself to maximize my fuckability according to gooners, or people obsessed with skinniness or youth
