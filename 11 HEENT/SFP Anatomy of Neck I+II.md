in the first hour posterior triangle is the area 

neck has cervical vertebrae, muscles, viscera (include parathyroid + thyroid gland)
- 4 longitudinal compartments
- 2 major trigangles 
the sternocleiomastoid will separate the triangles 

skeleton of neck 
- 7 C 
- hyoid bone - no articulations, floating, ligaments and muscles
	- this is a horseshoe that is an anterior body , has 2 horns. 
	- no articulation with any bones
	- but has a position that is very stable bc many ligaments + muscles
- clavicles - 
- menubrium + 1st rib 
- cartilaginous structures
- and the region j superior to that = root of neck. 
- thyroid cartilages anterior to the cervical vertebrae
- inferior to thyroid cartilages (2 laminae that come together anteriorly at an angle known as the anterior laryngeal prominence)
- cricoid = circular, anterior is not as steep as the posterior one 
- tracheal rings = horseshoe shapd cartilage is smaller and inferior to all the cricoid 

palpate these landmarks for physex
- lower border of mandible / jaw
- hyoid bone - where the jaw meets the neck 
- laryngeal prominence of thyroid cartilage - running down midline 
- cricoid cartilage - the divot where it would be , below the laryngeal prominence
- sternal end of clavicle 
posterior palpate
- external occipital protuberance
- mastoid process behind ears 
- transverse process to atlas - down slightly and beheath the earlobe... C1 location 
- just anterior to the transverse process to atlas  - angle of mandible 
- sternocleidomastoid - this is the key to neck , rotation makes ur neck pop out 

palpable superficial landmarks inferior to mandible 
- hyoid bone  - C3 
- laryngeal prominence of thyroid cartilage (made up of thyroid lamina coming together at that prominence) - C4 , where common carotid a will bifurcate
	- in between will go into the airway 
	- you must stick the tube or something in emergency to access that airway. so you want to not injure the vocal folds. 
- cricoid cartilage - will have retinoid caritlages that attach to vocal folds  , C6 level 
	- at this level, we see pharynx ends , esophagus begins, trachea begin. 
	- pharynx gets food and air and then it separates at C6 into airway + esophagus 
	- middle cervical sympathetic ganglion is here, where inferior thyroid artery passs up and over, mixing with the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and the isthmus of thyroid gland is there
		-  **note if you cut it during surgery - recurrent laryngeal nerve - you will have dead or dmg'd vocal fold on that side.**
- tracheal rings - the isthmus of the thyroid glands will cover these 2-4 rings. T2-3 level

at and below C6 = we see esophagus and trachea 
anteriorly there's a muscle in subcutaneous fascia , 
and invested into deep fascia. 
investing fascia will surround the whole neck 
- this fascia will come to enclose the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid, covering that posterior + anterior triangle. 
- also splits to enclose some muscles that attach/insert on hyoid bone 
- inside - additional fascia - prevertebral , muscles and lateral muscles (scalenes), annd deep msucles of the back
- prevertebral fascia make that vertebral compartments. 
- the nerves that will eventually go out to innervate stuff **emerge in this vertebral compartment region, which will then go between the anterior and middle scalene**
	- these are roots + trunk of the BP, making the axillary sheath . 

![[deep cervical fascia compartments.png]]
2 vascular copmartments holding the internal jugular v thruout the entire length of it 
above C4 (common carotid bifurcation)
- internal carotid is in the vascular comapartment - **external carotid is not in the vascular compartment**
- vagus nerve is part of the carotid sheath 

fascial spaces - the numbered regions - 1, 2, 3 
- pretracheal space, retropharyngeal , and prevertebral 
- pretracheal - sontinuoous into the thorax, to the superior mediastinum + anterior mediastinum 
	- - so if you have a thyroid elargement or tumor it'll move down to the heart. and 
	- similarly if you have an issue with mediastinum it can move up to the neck. 
- retropharyngeal = posterior mediastinum 
	-  infection spread is huge here 
- prevertebral= posterior mediastnum , but all the way down to diaphragm 
	- infection spread is huge here 

skin + platysma 
- muscle of fascial expression, ennervation by facial nerve 
- innervated by cervical br of facial n CN 7 
- we will see the lower portion of carotid gland there too, lowest br cervical branch 
ppl as they age get bands in their neck - the remnants of platysma just fyi 

cutaneous innervation of HEENT
![[cutaneous nn of scalp.png]]

- dermatomes are C2, and then at middle of neck = C3, and then at the root or base of neck more down it's C4!!! 
- posteriorly. these nerves are coming from the dorsal rami 
- and ventral rami + the cervical plexus who is made by the ventral rami supply the front. 

sensory branches all emerge from at the sternocleidomastoid on top of it, for the posterior triangle - they all come from the same or similar points, outside the deep fascia. 
- lesser occipital n - ascending to behind the ear 
- greater occipital nerve 
- great auricular - straight to the ear lobe 
- transverse cervical - crosses anterior aspect of neck 
- supraclavicular n - drapes over the clavicle 
they are all closely associated with the external jugular vein, piercing the deep fascia at the SCM lateral edge 
- anterior jugular vein tributaries get here under the chin, disappearing into SCM, and then the communicating br to the external jugular. 







i also forced myself to face my sexuality around a time i had a massive crush, which i shortly learned it would never happen. crushing and falling in love with people is so rare, so when it doesn't work out, or you're in a limbo of desperation and always thinking about one motherfucker all the time it is kinda excruciating. i only got to survive once i went a little outside my own body and told myself that this happens to everyone. same shit for breakups. i'm not a failure or im not unloveable this is just what happens

it's hard to give advice to someone i know when they're going through it all, cuz i know the feeling way too damn much. it feels like there's nothing that can be helped

anyway, i love that i've had people tell me it feels like i'm "normalizing" being very open about your sexuality. it's fun to be you and to be surrounded with people who fuck with YOU!!!! labels aren't important, and i think people do spend a lot of time stressing over which once best suits them, but i understand how it can be easier to understand yourself when you have a group of people to latch on to

had a few people come up to me at twitchcon to say the same thing, and it was a very full-circle moment. i didn't feel like myself up until i shared who i was to twitter, and on stream. i just kept repeating "im gay" over and over cuz idgaf if people think that's my only personality!! it's fun to be able to scream to the masses what was once a kinda shameful part of myself


prezoh - placing importance on whether my looks match what you personally find attractive is demonic and you should just watch porn or something. i look different from three years ago because i don't present myself to maximize my fuckability according to gooners, or people obsessed with skinniness or youth
