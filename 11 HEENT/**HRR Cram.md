all diff places that visual info synapses 
relayed in thru CN 2 
each optic tract has temporal retina of ipsi eye and **fibers from nasal retina of contra eye**
- majority of fibers would cross via the chiasm, and then move posterior -> into the optic tract (post-chiasm, visual field information)
fibers will start innervating: 
- hypothalamus to aid in regulating sleep/wake cycles and circadian rhythms 
- pretectum = involved with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pupillary light reflex</mark>, control of pupil + lens 
- superior colliculus - at level of the midbrain, orienting head and eye movements 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">integration of this visual with the auditory information too</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">lateral geniculate nucleus - subnucleus of the thalamus, the LGN</mark>
	- then from that LGN -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">travel thru the optic radiations to the calcarin sulcus of the occipital lobe</mark>

recall - the visual field flips at back of retina. superior -> inf and vice versa 

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">superior visual field -> inferior lower retina -> LGN -> meyer's looops => lower bank of calcarine</mark> ; pie in the sky ; meyer's loop will go thru the temporal lobe and eventually travel back ot the occipital. 
inferior field info -> superior retina -> LGN -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">optic radiations</mark> -> upper bank of calcarine 

if u lesion - 
- the R optic tract before LGN or the common R tract after the meyere's loop or the optic radiations come back togheter
- we lose out on the L side o both eyes!!! 

pie in the sky - contralateral superior quadrantopia = pie in the sky / lower bank in meyeres loop 
pie on the floor - contralateral inferior quadrantopia = optic radiations/upper bank 

contralateral homonymous hemianopia **with macular sparing = PCA infarc...** - lesioning both the upper and lower bank of the calcarine sulcus 
- having that macula spared... deficit in the contralateral homonymous hemianopia 
- but the macula is spared bc <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">macula's fed by the MCA, another artery1!!</mark>

pupillary light reflex - both eyes constrict with light 
- info -> retina -> optic nerve -> thru chiasm -> optic tract
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this bypasses the LGN to the pretectum instead</mark>
- pretectum at midbrain -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">bilateral projections thru the posterior commissure</mark> -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">edinger-westfall on both sides</mark>
- -> travel as preganglionic parasympathetic fibers as CN 3 -> ciliarry ganglion -> cause both constrictions 
if **one eye constrict but not the other - think pretectum impeding that communication** = the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tumor on the pineal gland cutting off f that posterior commissure.</mark>

motor eye movements
- CN 3 - 4 eye muscles 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">nucleus = oculomotor nucleus, medial as a motor nuclei, anterior to periaqueductal gray</mark>
	- exit thru the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">interpeduncular fossa</mark>
	- to **ipsilateral** inf rectus, inf oblique, and medial rectus and superior rectus 
- CN 4 - trochlear sup oblique m 
	- nucleus = the dorsal surface, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">caudal midbrain trochlear nucleus being medial bc motor -></mark>
	- then the nerve exits from dorsal surface -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CONTRALATERAL superior oblique muscle!!!</mark>
		- L trochlear nucleus -> L trochlear n -> RIGHT superior oblique muscle 
- CN 6 - lateral rectus 
	- traveling more caudal in brainstem - the abducens nucleus on the **floor of the 4th ventricle in the PONs** 
	- exits on the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pontine medullary junction</mark>, most medial 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle</mark>

horizontal eye movements - CN 3 and 6 
medial rectus = 3 
lateral rectus = 6 
superior colliculus would send information **contralateral projection into the<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> paramedian pontine reticular formation</mark>**, which sneds ipsilateral projection to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">abducens nucleus, which will send out both an ipsilateral R abducens N and the contralateral fiber to the contralateral L oculomotor nucleus</mark>
- CN3 on the other side is also activated . 

vertical eye movement - 3 and 4 
- superior + inf rectus and obliqeue muscles 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the rostral midbrain reticular formation is activated via contarlateral superior colliculi!!!!</mark>
- we need both vertical and horizontal gaze control via the Medial longitudinal fasciculus to connect both centers... 


auditory pathways - think CN 8 - vestibulocochlear n 
- the medial geniculate relays that auditory info -> auditory cortex in temporal lobe 
cochlea -> spiral ganglion -> cochlear component of CN 8, **synapsing int eh cochlear nuclei in the most lateral part of pontine medullary junction**
-> cochlear nucleus -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sends bilateral projections to the superior olives on the pons</mark> -> fibers go up from the superior olives to the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inferior colliculus!!!</mark> - tells more info of timing, intensity , frequentcy -> send info to the 
- superior colliculus 
- Medial geniculate nucleus of thalamus 
- -> up to thru the internal capsule to the **primary auditry cortex...**
- contralateral processing does happen more often... 
note - some o the contralateral auditory input to eh <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">lateral geniculate nucleus bypasses superior olive</mark> -> only sound detected by one ear,,,, with duration of sound being activated.

olfaction CN. 1 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">predominantly ipsilateral</mark>
olfactory bulb -> fibers of olfacotry nerves themselves traveling thru cribiform plate -> synapses in the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">olfactory bulbs, which are mitral tufted cells</mark> -> olfactory tract -> 
	-> pyriform cortex, the uncus, the ventromedial aspect of temporal lobe -> orbitofrontal cortex ; perception of smell + taste for finate things 
	-> olfacotry tubercle 
	-> amygdala 
	-> entorhinal cortex -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">mem aspect of smell -> hippocampal formation</mark>
		all these send to the hypothalamus (autonomic)
		and some to thalamus which sends to the orbitofrontal cortex 
- this is the only thing that doens't use thalamus as relay!!!

taste
CN 7, 9(bitters on back o tongue), 10 (taste buds on epiglottis itself)
taste buds -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">nucleus of solitary tract</mark> in the medulla, in rostral -> vPM of thalamus -> **insular** + frontal taste cortices... -> 
- end up in the hypothalamus (autonomc response)
- amygdala - emotional responses to these !!! 
- and some in the hippocampus as a memory for taste.
