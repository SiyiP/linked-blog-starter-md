#HEENT 
inlet for digestive 
and manipulates sounds produced by larynx -> speech 
bounds -
- roof = hard + soft palates
- lat walls= cheecks, muscular, merges anteriorly w lips surrounding oral fissure, facial expression msucle masseter m (innervaetd by facial nerve)
- floor - muscular diaphragm (mylohyoid + geniohyoid)

oral vestibule - bt anterior surface of teeth to inner lip = **outer**
- like where u pack dip with 
- oral fissure = the mouth anteriorly communicates with this and the cavity 
- parotid gland - empties into the **oral vestibule at area of the level 2nd maxillary molar thru parotid duct**

oral cavity proper - inner surface of anterior teeth to the **oropharyngeal isthmus(posteriormost opening into the oral pharynx)**
- bound by superior palates, the floor of mouth under, inner surfaces of teeth antriorly etc 

- oropharyngeal isthmus - made by : 
	- palatoglossal folds - seen anteriorly like curtains laterally (differentiate frm the palatoglossys muscle)
	- soft palate superiorlly bound 
	- terminal sulcus of tongue inferiorly - depression that divides from anterior vs posterior 1/3 
	- can be opened + closed by surrounding tissues 
	- and food/liquid is held in the oral cavity while breathing when the isthmus is closed. 
- skeletal frameowrk of oral cavity 
	- paired bones = maxillae = hard balate
	- palatine bones near the back 
	- tmeporal bones = on the very middle. 
	- sphenoid bones = unpaired. on the sides. 
- incisive foramen = nerve passes = **nasopalatine nerve to supply the anterior mucosa of the hard palate**
	- this is accompanied by the vessels - sphenopalatine vessels 
	- greater palatine vessels (not related to this) exit on the greater palatine foramen 
	- lesser palatine vessels thru the lesser palatine foramen 

mandible
- superior + inf mental spine
- sublingual fossa - where sublingual gland is 
- mylohyoid line - on the inner surface, where mylohyoid m will attach 
- submandibular fossa = where the submandibular gland is 
- mandibular foramen = **the inferior alveolar nerve goes thru here, CN V3**
	passes thru the mandibular canal -> and then give brs to teeth 

teeth arrange in maxillary + mandibular arches/AKA alveolar arches
32 adult teeth 
- central incisors, lateral incisors
- canines
- 1st + 2nd premolar 
- 1-3rd molar 
- surrounded by gums called gingiva 
- in adult - teeth erupts around age 6, with the 3rd molar not there til age 17-30 
30 deciduous teeth = **baby teeth, come before**
- erupt bt 6 mon - 2 yrs of age 
- 20 teeth 
	- central incisors
	- lateral incisors 
	- canines
	- 1st and 2nd primary molar 
no premolars and no 3rd molar. 

blood supply of teeth + gingivae - from **maxillary artery, wiht the external carotid artery ascending and then going into the scalp and the other branch going into the maxillary artery hooking into the infratemporal fossa in the cheek!!!**
- maxillary artery = 
![[vessels in maxillary and mandibular face.png]]
these maxillary teeth will be supplied
posterior and superior alveolar a => supplies the premolars and the molar teeth . 

branch of the **infaorbital artery in the pteropalatine fossa -> anterior** superior alveolar a + v - supplies canines + incisors 

mandibular teeth - 
- gt all blood supply from the inf alveolar a, which is a br of maxillary artery 
- this will accompany the **inferior alveolar n thru the mandibular foramen thru the mandibular canal**

innervation of teeth + gingivae 
- all innervaition from the CN V 
- maxillary teeth - 
	- ant superior alveolar n + middle superior alveolar n 
		- the brs of infraorbital n V2 
		- will supply canines + premolars 
	- posterior superior alveolar n 
		- direct br o the maxillary n V2
		- **before it gets to the teeth, the posterior superior alveolar nerve would innervate the mucosa of maxillary sinus!!!**
		- as it travels down it will innervate the 3 molars 
- mandibular teeth = from inf alveolar nerve V3 
- **maxillary gingivae - brs of CN V2** 
	- not interested in the gingival specific stuff 
- **mandibular gingivae - brs of CN V3** 
	- not interested in the gingival specific stuff 
![[V2 and V3 innervation of face.png]]

rooof of oral cavity 
- hard cavity = floor of the nasal cavity, boney plate covred above + below by mucosa 
	- lined by : palatine rugae = 
	- palatine raphe = this **median longitudinal line that shows why we have the fusion of palatine cells**
	- incisive papillae = on top of the incisive fossa/foramen wich allows access 
- soft txtens from hard palate, 
blood supply of palate
- extrnal carotid a -> 
	- ascending pharyngeal artery would be coming from external carotid
	- facial a -> from ascending palatine a 
	- heavy hitter. - maxillary artery, will give rise in the pteropalatine fossa:
		- descending palatine a 
			- greater palatine a = **swings to hard palatee** 
			- lesser palatine a = swings to soft palate


innervation of palate 
- recall mucosa of hard balate = **3 brs of v2.**.. thru the greater palatine nerve or able body nerd
	- - the greater + lesser palaitine nervs would extend down from the infrior aspct of the pteropalatine ganglion
	- general sensory: recall; 
		- greater palatine nerve V2 - descends thru the PT fossa + palatine canal 
		- nasopalatine n V2 - from the PT fossa, travels thru the nasal cavity, then descneds thru incisive canal 
- general sensory of SOFT palate
	- lesser palatine n V2 goes thru the lesser palatine foramen into the soft palate. 

walls: cheeks
- consists of skin , buccinator muscle (CN7), oral mucosa , and 
- bucinator m - holds cheeks against alveolar arches, keeping food bt teeth when chewing + suction
- works with the orbicularis oris to let u use a straw!!! 

floor -
- muscular diaphragm of paired mylohyoid 
	- hammock for tongue insertiono into hyoid bone body in the median raphe combining the two 
	- elevation of hyoid bone, base of tongue, floor of mouth 
	- nerve to **mylohyoid**
		- also innervates the  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anterior digastric m</mark>
		- bc the posterior digastric m is innervated by facial nerve 
	- the mandibular foramen = the inferior alveolar nerve will go thru this on the side!<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> will give rise to  nerve to **mylohyoid** **before** the inferior alveolar nerve enters the foramen!!!!</mark>
- paired geniohyoid deep to the diaphragm/superior to it 
	- from inf mental spine on mandible to hyoid 
	- elevates hyoid + depress mandible 
	- innervation = **ventral ramus of C1 spinal nerve as it is via the hypoglossal n*
		- this hypoglossal nerve supplies **all muscles of tongue except palatoglossus m*
		- know that the C1 would hitch a ride and leave as:
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">superior root of ansa cervicalis </mark> to supply the infrahyoid STREP muscles!
			- nerve to thyrohyoid 
			- nerve to geniohyoid 
- tongue superior to that geniohyoid mm 
	- tongue covered with striated muscle covered with mucosa 
	- anterior 2/3 of oral cavity = terminal sulcus divider
	- pharyngeal = posterior 1/3rd o tongue bc project onto the oropharynx 
	- intrinsic and extrinsitc muscles = they count as both! bulk of it are paired muscles! 
		- intrinsic muscles 
			- **longitudinal, transverse, and vertical = all 3 orientations**
			- helps to do precise movements to speech, eat, etc 
			- innervation by **hypoglossal nerve**
		- extrinsic muscles
			- from structures from outside of tongue in origin 
			- protrude, retract, depress + elevate tongue 
			- genioglossus m CN 12
				- seen first, fan of the tongue 
				- fan shaped attaching into the **superior mental spine of mandible, blending posteriorly with the other tonogue fibers**
				- protruds the tONgue **anteriorly!!!**
				- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">test this! by sticking out your tongue! and stay at midline... but if there's injury it'll deviate to the injured hypoglossal side </mark>
			- hyoglossus CN 12
				- lateral aspect, rectangle. + flat 
				- attaches to teh body + greater hyoid bone horn and superiorly with tongue muscles ... 
				- **depresses** + **retracts the tongue!**
				- important landmark in the oral cavity floor!
				- **lingual artery enters toongue DEEP to hyoglossus m**
				- **CN12 and lingual nerve (br of CN V3) enter tongue on external surface of this hyoglossus m**
			- styloglossus CN 12
				- blends into lateral aspect of tongue 
				- from the styloid of temporal bone and blends anteriorly with tongue fibers
				- retracts and **draws up tongue for swallowing**
			- palatoglossus CN X
				- note the innervation = **from soft palate inserting into the tongue laterally!!!!**
				- **from palatine aponeuosis / soft palate** - basically layer of soft palate blending laterally 
				- elevates **posterior tongue + depresses soft palate!!! draws the root of tongue superiorly + posteriorly**
				- when it's **covered by mucosa.... we call it the paatoglossal fold!!!!**, making the lateral boundaries of the oropharyngeal isthmus!!!!
				- ![[palatal muscles.png]]
				- if the mucosa's intact it's the palatoglossal fold but if it's gone its the palatoglossus muscle 
	- features of tongue: 
		- terminal sulcus dividing anterior posterior parts
		- pharyngeal parts = lymphoid tissues on posterior 1/3 called **lingual tonsils**
		- along the terminal sulcus - the remnant of thyroglossal duct = **foramen cecum**
		- folliate papillae = no taste buds !! most numerous and have nerv endings 
		- fungiform  papillae - rounder, 
		- vallate papillae - fewest but largest - in shape of terminal sulcus 
		- foliate papillae - found on lateral aspect of tongue 
salivary glands + ducts : sublingual gland completely in oral cavity + submandibular glands.. has external part 

in the face = is the parotid gland 

blood supply of tongue 
- receives majorly the **lingual artery**
	- which is a branch of the **external carotid artery**
	- next to the tip of greater horn of hyoid bon
	- travels bt hyoglossus + genioglossus muscles to apex of tongue 
	- also supplies the sublingual gland, gingiva + oral mucosa in floor of oral cavity 

innervation of tongue 
- all muscles are innervated by hypoglossal n except palatoglossus which gets X 
- general sensory 
	- anterior 2/3rd is by lingual n V3 , coming 
		- V3 emerges out of the foramen ovale ->
		- lingual nerve -> infratempooral fossa , and got both motor + sensory information with it 
	- posterior 1/3 is by the glossopharyngeal n CN IX !!!
		- also helps out posteriorly with some taste
- special sensory taste 
	- anterior 2/3 of tongue - **chorda tympani - br of the CN 7, facial nerve!!!** the chorda tympani's **joining that lingual nerve -> giving taste**
	- posterior 1/3 glossopharyngeal n CN IX 

floor of that oral cavity - salivary glands 
- they are large - except the parotids which are outside
- submandibular(portion is external) and sublingual are there. - these are large and paired ones 
- digetstion, lubrication, taste, prevent tooth decay 
- sublingual gland
	- smallest, in the sublingual fossa against medial surface of mandible 
	- superior to the mylohyoid + lateral to the submandibular duct 
	- drains into the oral cavity via ducts opening into **crest of the sublingual fold.** from gland itself
- submandibular gland - hook shaped 
	- superficial part = outside of oral cavity, bt myohyoid muscle + mandible 
	- deep part - hooking **around myohyoid muscle, lateral to root of tongue**
	-  the submandibular DUCT emerges from medial side of deep part, passes right OVER **lingual nerve**  - lingual nerve **loops under this submandibular duct**
		- also will pass thru the floor of the oral cavity , opening on the **sublingual caruncle** - this is just lateral to the frenulum of the tongue 

parasympathetic innervation of salivary glands - 
sublingula + submandibular glands get singals 
- origination from CN 7, br of chorda tympani -> joining the **preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the LINGuAL nerve V3, which carries that information from the inratemporal fossa into the oral cavity**
- gangliono - is in the oral cavity as the **submandibular ganglion**
	- the ganglion would then send postganglionic parasympathetics to the submandibular and sublinguals. 

lymphatic drainage - from tip of tongue to **submental nodes**
remaining parts =. **the lateral tongue + back tongue drain to the submandibular nodes**
**palate = drain to deep cervical nodes directly**
