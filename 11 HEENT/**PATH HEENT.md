pathology 
1. torticollis - contraction of cervical muscles producing twisting of neck + slanting of head
	1. see muscular commonly - children congenital
		1. might require PT or surgical intervention 
		2. can be acquired due to infection or trauma
		3. we see fibrous tissue tumor in SCM , injury from birth, or hematoma + fibrotic mass entrappign CN XI, denervating SCM!!
	2. spasmodic 
		1. cervical dystonia , 
		2. happens in adults, might combine with trapezius 
		3. somethings's wrong with the nerve transiently 
		4. sustained malpositioning, and shoulder can be elevate + anteriorly displaced. 
2. subclavian a comprression 
	1. pressure in subclavian triangle 
	2. superior to clavicle, inf/anterior to the inferior belly of omohyoid m
	3. main arterial supply to upper limb 
3. aberrant thyroid tissue = thyroid gland - develops from a downgrowth from a thyroglossal duct 
	1. some ppls thyroid glands fail to move down, having thyroglossal duct, it being below the tongue
	2. other ppl might drop little dips of tissue, whch might be continuous = a **pyramidal lobe**
	3. aberrant thyroid tissue = **always superior to the isthmus, where t's supposed to drop down. diff from thyroid overgrowth**
4. aberrant parathyroid; tumor while its in the mediastinum 
	1. bone breakdown, hgih ca levels
	2. if in embryological dev, the 3rd brachial pouch continues to migrate together down with the thymus 
	3. will be in the mediastinum- we need good imaging 

facial 
 pain distribution in CN V, usually V2. 
	1. more in women than men 
	2. pain in skin, teeth, tongue, mouth, nose 
	3. inc incidence with age, 
	4. MS , 
	5. TREAT: alc/glycerol injection thru foramen OVALE for injection into the ganglion 
	6. insertion of small balloon sometimes to stretch that semilunar ganglion = percutaneous rhizotomy 
2. if we get an injury at the lacrimal gland, near the N to stapedius
	1. injury right outside the internal acoustic meatus , -> dry eye loss of parasympathetic innervation to lacrimal glands
	2. hyperacusis - paralysis of stapedius muscle between the ganglion + stapedius bc inhibits the quality of sound 
	3. lesion at chorda tympani - loss of taste in 2/3rds of tongue + also **loss of submandibular + sublingual salivary glands**
	4. lesion right before exiting the stylomstoid foramen => paralysis of facial expression muscle 
![[facial nerve route and lesions.png]]
3. Bell's palsy - viral or inflammation -> swelling of nerve coverings
	1. you get one side of face paralyzed 
	2. this is due to impaired nerve conduction or injury due to restricted face
	3.  Treat - prednisone, coritcosteroids, antiinflammatory, most recover fully 

path: tonsilitis - bacterial infection, sore throat, high fever, bad breath + palatine tonsil inflammation... bc of **accumulation of bacteria in the crypts** - making **tonsil stone calcifications, sulfurous**
				- deep cervical lymph nodes draining tonsils are enlarged and tender.
				- tonsillectomy - indicated for repeated infections
				- complication = **hemorrhages... bc tonsillar artery br of facial artery is in that **tonsillar sinus**
				- largest supplier of blood is tonsillar a from the facial artery, but also these tonsillar branches from all these other areas too. 
				- also external palatine veins' pretty large and in there. 

path: 
CN X palsy 
- going liek "aaa" to see soft palate raise bilaterally 
- - unilateraly injury to CN X will cause dysphagia due to paralysis on injured side 
- also seen is **contralateral** deviation of **uvula during elevation = CN X dysfunction = levator veli palatini + muscularus uvulae** are **unopposed**. 
1. horner syndrome , can be on affected side 
	1. lesion of cervical sympathetic trunk -> sympathetic dysfunction 
	2. anhidrosis(no sweating), ptosis(droop upper eyelid), miosis(small pupils, paralysis of dilator pupillae muscles, unopposed action of the sphincter muscles CN3 ), enophthalmos(sinking in of eye)
	3. causes can be smth operative trauma to the inferior cervical/stellate ganglion 
	4. pressure on the inf cervical ganglion or sympathetic trunk - enlarged cervical nodes, upper mediastinal tumor, carotid aneurysm or mass in neck.

embryology 
malformations 
1. cleft lip - involving the **medial and maxillary prominences**
	1. uniilat or bilat 
	2. in upper lip 
	3. more common in men 
2. cleft plate - palatine shelves + nasal septum. 
	1. form the maxillary, palate hard and / or soft 
	2. fused here - involving the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">medionasal prominnence </mark>
	3. deep maxillary -> cleft palate ;
rare clefts
- oblique facial cleft - failed fuion of lateral nasal and maxilary prominences. going from 
	- wide cleft form upper limpt o lower limg 
- macrostomia - huge mouth 
	- lateral facial cleft - huge mouth, ften uniilateral
	- incomplete fusionof maxillary + mandibular prominences, muscles of facial expresion impacte 
- median cleft lip - incomplete merge fo **medial nasal prominences**
	- this is what it sounds like a midlint cleft from upper liip to the nose 
	- can be associated with CNS/ brain activities 

frontal nasal dysplasia - wide set midline 
- spectrum can be sen in malformations duet o abnormal dev 
	- hypertelorism = wide set eyes
	- broad nasal root 
	- midline facial clefts
	- brain or skull anomalies 
	- embyolologically these get disrupted n frontonasal prominence dev, so proper fusion failure or thorwn off bc of medial nasal structure
	- try to do surgitcal corection + imging and consultations - looks like avatar
malformations
1. macroglossia - large tongue 
2. microglossia - small tongue 
3. ankyloglossia - tongue-tie; restricted movement bc **incomplete regression of frenulum during development**
	1. speech impairment 
irst arch syndrome -
4. **pierre robin sequence**
	1. maldev of 1st pharyngeal arch 
	2. micrognathia - underdevelopped mandible (arch); super recessed chin/jaw hard for them to breathe. 
	3. glossoptosis - posterior displacement of the tongue, the palatine plates and stuff would be placed too far back, from the ceiling in the medial area downwards... so cleft palate is made 
		1. short mandible / mandibular hypoplasia before week 9 -> displace big tongue posterirly ; **glossoptosis**
		2. **palatal shelves can't fuse**
		3. cleft palate!
	4. ear anomales due to the cleft + pouch 
		1. triad: miicrognathia, glossoptosis, airway obstructure with cleft palate 73-90% U shaped , wide cleft palate 
	5. feeding + breathing difficulties, middle ear dysfunction as recurrent ottitis media 
5. treacher collins syndrome -mandibulofacial dysostosis , serioous 
	1. mandibular hypoplasia - or j not develop 
	2. cleft palate due to disrupted facial function 
	3. **zygomatic bone underdevelopment with flattened cheekbones**
	4. external ear malformations - absent pinnae
	5. **bilateral symmetric involvement**
	6. lower eyelid <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">colobomas</mark> - **notches + gaps in eyelid tissue = wiith displacement of zygomatic bones** ; slanted palpebral fissures, orbital rim defects too. 
	7. more serious - airway obstruction with **micrognathia ): hard to intubate them with cleft palate + breathing issues**, feeding hard, hearing loss structurally , and req lots of care
	8. normal cog development 
	9. often inivolve the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">TCOF1</mark> gene chrom 5 

lateral cysts, sinuses, fistulas - persistent pharyngeal grooves aka clefts? 
- especially with the cervical sinus formed by 2-4 grooves, which coalesce and meant to disappear 
- would be fistulas lateral on neck near Sternocleidomastoid muscle
	- branchial cleft cyst - fluid filled, non-communicating
	- bracbranchialhial sinus - open tract to skin or pharynx
	- branchial fistula - complete tract there 
	- needs surgical excision + risk of infection 

thyroglossal duct remnants  - can get infected and seen anywhere along that path f the thyroid 
- thyroid primordium would originate at foramen cecum, then migrates, and then leaves that thyroglossal duct 
- ectopic thyroid tissue can happen anywhere along that path 
- key thing - we need to confirm normal thyroid presence be4 removal - maybe they're missing that only one. 

pharyngeal pouches - ectopic **parathyroid + thymic tissue**
- they can get stuck or go further down , so all that can be in weird locations 
- thymic tissue from 3rd pharyngeal pouch, and go all the way down. but some will remain, making accessory thymic tissue + accessory tissue

 1. digeorge syndrome
	1. NCCs - deficient, so they don't migrate where they are suppoed to therefore - **impaired dev of 3rd + 4th pharyngeal pouches**
	2. so duh thymic hypoplasia + hypoparathyroidism 
	3. immune response nerved by a ton, 
	4. **TBX1 gene mutations**; part of the 22nd chromosomes etc. 
	5. cleft palate, micrognatha, small mouthm, smooth philtrum, nasal bridge + posteriorly rotated ears
	6. **persistent truncus arteriosus PTA**
- **huge diff = this is the one that causes immune deficiency!!!**
VS: 
1. CHARGE syndrome - affects NCC migration + craniofacia dev
	1. CHD7 gene
	2. smilar to digeorge 
	3. Coloboma of eye - missing tissue of eye - or a hole 
	4. Heart defects - tetralogy of fallot 
	5. Atresa of choanae - blocking of nasal 
	6. Retardtion of growth/dev 
	7. Genital anomalies liek hypogonadism 
	8. Ear abnormaliities like deafness

1st/2nd branchial anomalies - 
- cyst = walled off
- sinus = opening into the skin 
- fistula = opening like tube to another structure 
- work type 1 = ectoderm derived, j **superficial to the facial nerve, so lateral to it and less common
- work type 2 = more serious - ectoderm + mesoderm derived, lined by sq epithelium + has adnexa + cartilage, course around CN7 is all variable, exiting near cheek 
	- we need to get the superficial parotidectomy to find the facial nerve to remove that cyst or whatever...

2nd branchial anomalies- more common - a fistula anterior to the SCM, and facial nerve is the cyst
- lateral to CN 9 + 12 , medial to posterior belly + digastric + stylohyoid 
- tonsillar fossa = the true fistula will end in the **2nd pharyngeal location with that tonsillar fossa**
- assoiations: with branchiootorenal syndrome, preauricular pits/tags, auricular deformities, deafness, temporal bone anomaliieis 

external ear - 
- any arrest of ext ear dev = microtia. 
- mostly sporadic maybe insjury to the stapedial artery or some teratogenic 
- graded :  = **floppy stick out ears**, 2 has all structures but small. 3 = some cartilage but requires reconstructure, and 4 = no ears ; **conductive hearing loss grade 3+**
- prominorris - having all the structures, but most cartilage is missing, might need or want otoplasty with some cutting of skin 
- observation til 5-8 years old ++ allows bone browth of ribs + development of contralateral **normal ear
- we should **repair microtiia external ear before atresia**
often ppl wh have this have <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum = OAVs</mark>
- hemifacial microsomiia 
- dysplasia
- mandible twisted, 2nd most common 
- facial asym, epibulbar dermoids 
- mandibular hypoplasia, coloboma 
- affected side might be subtle 

all about cleft lip 
- - complete - involvs the alveolus **and nasal floor**
- incomplete - does'nt involve the nasal floor 
beau classification 
- type 1 - cleft of soft palate only 
- type.2 = clefts of hard + soft palate restricted to secondary palate - palate posterior to incisive foramen 
- 3 = unilateral cleft involving 2ndary + primary palate - this is atnerior to incisive foramen 
- 4 = bilateral cleft w complete median tubercle isolation 
- cleft palate would have more fluid = higher risk of otitis media bc th levator will open up to the ear ; we need to avoid feeding tubes if we don't need it... can't make suction so failure to thrive. 
- - cleft lip + alveolus - **attempt moms feeding method + monitor closely weight**
NAM - nasoalveolar molding - with a device where you bring out the premaxilla - surgical with taping+ lip repair . 
cleft lip repair - rule of 10s
- 10+ wks
- 10+ pounds 
- 10+ hgb. 

airway/feedings 
- - **stickler syndrome CT disease with joints and 22q11.2 deletion most common**
- - positioning, nasopharyngeal airway placement, CPAP + supp o2  = conservative treatments 
- surgical : tracheostomy, tongue lip adhesion, mandibular distraction osteogeneiss
	- MDO = will directly address primary problem of micrognathia and long term benefits by lengthening the mandible - one way to elongate the jaw  = need longterm followup 
	- will implante a device, in planning be careful of the lymph nodes 
	- some complication rates 20-30%  - the devce goes in slowly with teh screws!
	- pins come out and slowly move the jawforwards - like **braces but with the mandible with lengthening


1. anencephaly - cranially - open and MOST common CNS malformation - 
	1. at 28 days gestation + not compatible with life ; no brain  
	2. cerebrovasculosa - CNS tissue would aggregate abnoramlly , CSF fluid is very caustic - 
2. encephalocele - brain outside the cranium but will be covered by skin 
	1. uncommon but super variable 
	2. some are adult acquired- mastoiditis and chronic sinusitis = where the inflammation would eat thru the bone!!! 
	3. in a baby: occipital outpuoching is the most common 
3. spinal dysraphism - spinal cord doesn't close 
	1. myelomenigocele - cord, the meninges protrudes togehter more often + worse scenario
	2. lumbosacral-bladder bowel + walking issues is the location 
	3. chiari malformation is associated , type 2 
note - AFP often up bc made by CNS, and open neural tube means it gets into her bloodstream. control with prenatals, diabetes control change antiseizure meds, and ultrasounds 

posterior fossa anomalies - 
1. chiari malformations 
	1. type 1 = tonsil of cerebellum hangs down and obstructs spinal canal ; adult coming in w/ headaches + problms 
	2. type 2 = vermis hangs down and obstructs, making a beak. = this is what we see in the lumbosacral **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">myelomenigocele</mark>** in spinal dysraphism
	3. type 3 = encephalocele
2. dandy-walker malformation  = part of vermis is missing bc of the big cyst that cuases hydrocephalus!!!!!
	1. dev delays in everything 
3. cerebral aqueduct problems = can be viral in kids, stenosis or forking meaning tiny bits and pieces making worthless openings that doesn't flow 

forebrain anomalies
1. arrhinecephaly - no olfactory - anosmia, no other issues 
2. holoprosencephaly - dev delay, intellectual disab + midlne facial problems!!!
	1. facial often mirrors the brain or cerebral issues 
	2. lobar = good hemisphere division, lobe formation, midline **fusion.**
	3. semilobar - **pseudo hemisphere division but no lobes!**
	4. alobar - no hemi no lobes 
	5. monoventricle + fusion of basal ganglia on mri 
	6. think <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">trisomy 13 and 18, and teratogens too</mark>

migration defects = think **common seizures,**
- cells that end up in the cortex start in the ventricles.
- cells that will go thru the radial glia -> cortex. = this is physiological 
- layer 6 would migrate up first. 
- normal fetal brain - has dark gray matter + germinal matrix.... which have nuclei in caudate + germinal matrix (migrates out?) 
1. agyria - lissencephaly - birth with no gyri ; not survivable 
2. pachygyria - really fat gyri, some look normal but some are just too thick.  
3. polymicrogyria - small gyri, no real sulci bc very bumpy, looks "too busy"; usually 4 or less layers where the normal are usually 6 layers in the cortex. 
4. gray matter heterotopiias - periventricular gray matter which would **mature in place instead of migrating or regressing - this tends to be too many nuclei or ventricles, all in the occipital or some lesions = many seizures**

destructive lesions - in mca territory or larger - vascular issue many times bilateral... 
1. focal = destruction all the way down to the center - 
	1.  seizures common , some ventricles but too much space, porencephaly loss of gray matter
2. widespread = hydranecephaly - MCA and midline destruction  - cells never make it to that cortex ; is normal then just abruptly stops 
3. cavum septum - super common = 2 separate leaflets in septum in between the lateral hemispheres, never fuse!!! small cave/hole bt the 2 lateral ventricles - no effect
4. corpus callosum agenesis 
	1. "bat sign" on imaging 
	2. can be isolated/associated
	3. partial - based on lipoma not making it dev normally? 
5. spinal cord malformatin - 
	1. hydromelia - central canal too big, abnormal widening of the central canal of the spinal cord that creates a cavity in which cerebrospinal fluid 
	2. springomyelia - with tissue hole, can see as developmental issue or with some kinda  tumor ; development of a fluid-filled cyst within the spinal cord.
	3. diastomyelia - centrally there's a separator that makes 2 divisions of a canal - usually in lumbosacral region 
		1. **Diastematomyelia, a type of spina bifida**, describes a congenital spinal dysraphism resulting in a split cord malformation. The spinal cord is longitudinally divided into two 'hemicords,' each surrounded by its own dural tube and separated by a midline bony spur or cartilaginous or fibrous ridge or band.

brain injuries in perinatals... and premies most commonly 
1. subarachnoid hemorrhage is very common and frequent after birth !
2. bleeding in ventricls coming thru posterior fossa 
3. germinal matrix hemorhage = tiiny blood vessels in the germinal matrix - don't take the bp change from baby to adult formation well 
	1. will expand and blow out the ventricles
4. hypooxic/ischemic dmg - worse at the bottom of the base of the brain , base of the sulcus, 
	1. makes <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ulegyria - looks like mushroom, thin little springs</mark>
	2. widespread grey matter dmg with 2ndary white matter loss 
	- in babies - periventricular white matter dmg ... in  premies oligodendrocytes sensitive to hypoxic dmg (not true in adults), so white matter tracts are killed
	- s<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">urviving kid would myelinated things incorrectly after</mark>
5. kernicterus - bilirubin. no BBB yet
