2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">extradural</mark> hematoma - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">shearing of **meningeal arteries**, </mark>
	1. filling blood bt potential space bt bone + external periosteal dura, typically caused by trauma 
	2. see this lesion - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">**convex shape into the brain!! and sorta whiteish, shift of falx cerebri away from midline**</mark>
3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">subdural</mark> hematoma - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tearing of **cerebral veins**</mark>
	1. blood fills space bt dura + arachnoid , 
	2. caused by trauma, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">excessive movement of brain in cranium </mark>
	3. an older or younger person, like in a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">car accident</mark> with inertia... 
	4. worry for older person bc the cavity has more space for brain to move due to atrophy 
	5. on CT, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cresent accumulation</mark>, long one, and we see<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> **deviation of LATERAL ventricles away!!!**</mark>

4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">subarachnoid</mark> hemorrhage - rupture of arteries within the brain - i<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">nternal carotid a, circle of willis </mark>
	1. blood in subarachoid space, the only true functional space. 
	2. cuased by<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> aneurysm + trauma. </mark>
	3. see acucmulation, subarachnoid cisterns contianing blood
	4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">worst headache</mark> in someones life
	5. typically **fatal and fast**


pathology 
1. torticollis - contraction of cervical muscles producing twisting of neck + slanting of head
	1. see muscular commonly - children congenital
		1. might require PT or surgical intervention 
		2. can be acquired due to infection or trauma
		3. we see fibrous tissue tumor in SCM , injury from birth, or hematoma + fibrotic mass entrappign CN XI, denervating SCM!!
	2. spasmodic 
		1. cervical dystonia , 
		2. happens in adults, might combine with trapezius 
		3. somethings's wrong with the nerve transiently 
		4. sustained malpositioning, and shoulder can be elevate + anteriorly displaced. 
2. subclavian a comprression 
	1. pressure in subclavian triangle 
	2. superior to clavicle, inf/anterior to the inferior belly of omohyoid m
	3. main arterial supply to upper limb 
3. aberrant thyroid tissue = thyroid gland - develops from a downgrowth from a thyroglossal duct 
	1. some ppls thyroid glands fail to move down, having thyroglossal duct, it being below the tongue
	2. other ppl might drop little dips of tissue, whch might be continuous = a **pyramidal lobe**
	3. aberrant thyroid tissue = **always superior to the isthmus, where t's supposed to drop down. diff from thyroid overgrowth**
4. aberrant parathyroid; tumor while its in the mediastinum 
	1. bone breakdown, hgih ca levels
	2. if in embryological dev, the 3rd brachial pouch continues to migrate together down with the thymus 
	3. will be in the mediastinum- we need good imaging 

facial 
 pain distribution in CN V, usually V2. 
	1. more in women than men 
	2. pain in skin, teeth, tongue, mouth, nose 
	3. inc incidence with age, 
	4. MS , 
	5. TREAT: alc/glycerol injection thru foramen OVALE for injection into the ganglion 
	6. insertion of small balloon sometimes to stretch that semilunar ganglion = percutaneous rhizotomy 
2. if we get an injury at the lacrimal gland, near the N to stapedius
	1. injury right outside the internal acoustic meatus , -> dry eye loss of parasympathetic innervation to lacrimal glands
	2. hyperacusis - paralysis of stapedius muscle between the ganglion + stapedius bc inhibits the quality of sound 
	3. lesion at chorda tympani - loss of taste in 2/3rds of tongue + also **loss of submandibular + sublingual salivary glands**
	4. lesion right before exiting the stylomstoid foramen => paralysis of facial expression muscle 
![[facial nerve route and lesions.png]]
3. Bell's palsy - viral or inflammation -> swelling of nerve coverings
	1. you get one side of face paralyzed 
	2. this is due to impaired nerve conduction or injury due to restricted face
	3.  Treat - prednisone, coritcosteroids, antiinflammatory, most recover fully 

path: tonsilitis - bacterial infection, sore throat, high fever, bad breath + palatine tonsil inflammation... bc of **accumulation of bacteria in the crypts** - making **tonsil stone calcifications, sulfurous**
				- deep cervical lymph nodes draining tonsils are enlarged and tender.
				- tonsillectomy - indicated for repeated infections
				- complication = **hemorrhages... bc tonsillar artery br of facial artery is in that **tonsillar sinus**
				- largest supplier of blood is tonsillar a from the facial artery, but also these tonsillar branches from all these other areas too. 
				- also external palatine veins' pretty large and in there. 

path: 
CN X palsy 
- going liek "aaa" to see soft palate raise bilaterally 
- - unilateraly injury to CN X will cause dysphagia due to paralysis on injured side 
- also seen is **contralateral** deviation of **uvula during elevation = CN X dysfunction = levator veli palatini + muscularus uvulae** are **unopposed**.
