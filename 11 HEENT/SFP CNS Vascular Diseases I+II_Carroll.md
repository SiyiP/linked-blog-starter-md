neuropath of stroke 
start with a case: think about how to localize it? what's being occluded? 
poorly treated htn, to ER, sevre headache at 6:30 AM, 
bloody lumbar puncture - stable for 4 days then rapid deteriorated
- right hemiparesis - stuporous and then died 
- arteries! 
- anatomically localized: right hemiparesis, 
- anatomic localization = the **left cerebral hemisphere...**
chemical meningitis = **stiff neck = blood** in subarachnoid space 
- the bloody lumbar puncture - something arterial going on since bloods not clearing 


understand: high pressure + low pressure bleeds - have difff anatomies, develop in dif time courses + diff consequences
- high pressure bleeds - arterial, rapidly evolving minutes to hours
- low pressure bleeds - venous, develop over days to weeks or mnths 
pathology - can be predicted by knowing where + how long the blood supply's disrupted
and know - there's weak spots of brain prone to vascular injury 

biggie - 3rd most common cause of death 
- stroke - an abrupt onset of focal/global neuro symptoms caused by ischemia or hemorrhage... 24+ hr duration
	- but this enompasses many other specific pathologies 
- only 10% of survivors return to normal activity 


brain is 2.5% body weight but 15% of arterial blood supply 
- internal carotid system - supplies above that tentorium 
	- cerebral cortex supplied by ACA MCA, and PCA = this is in the circumferential arteries ,  
	- short circumferential = come from **proximal parts of long circumferential aa, into the deep parts like basal ganglia**
	- **paramedian arteries** - supplie base of brain near midline 
- vertebro-basilar symptoms supplies below the tentorium 

case2 - hx of MI 10 yrs previously + CHF, and then collapsed, get a dense L hemiparesis with upgoing toe on left side... no spontaneous resps + idioventricular cardiac rhythm 
- so it's arterial, hx of <3 stuff is thromboemboli + atherosclerosis 
- L hemiparesis = localizing thing 
- and upgoing toe - **anterior circulation taken out**, maybe some of the middle
- patient given fluid restriction + decadron... **tries to get edema down from brain**


failsafes in brain arterial circ 
- anastomoses with circle of willis,
- opthalmiic artery - external + niternal carotids
- leptomeningeal arteries = brs of majojr cerebral arteries
- intraparenchymal arteries

how do u have a stroke with all these failsafes??
- 12 yo girl impaled on car antenna... impaling her neck.  - antenna was in the internal carotid artery, worries about embolizing it so they clamped either side 
	- she was fine. she was young, little to no atherosclerosis + failsafes were good 
- 68 yo women with glomus tumor - specialized drill needs to drill that bone , and then they used diff drill in surgery 
	- slashed her carotid artery open ): 
	- clamped the carotid artery + joined back together 
	- she woke up with huge hemiparesis on one half... so atherosclerosis = > compromise to the failsafes -> stroke

bland infarctions - happen with the blood supply cutoff
- acute 1 day - 1 wk - involved area is soft, edematous + anatomic detail blurred
	- seen neurons start to die - eosinophilic neuronal necrosis - basically we see the cytoplasm is red + nucleus is small and dense 
	- 24-72 hours out - polymorphonuclear leukocytes invade brain, breaking down BBB
	- then edema starts
	- brain looks very asymmetrical 
- subacute 1 wk - 1 mon - obv tissue destruction + liquefactive necrosis 
	- breakdown of BBB reaches its worse, edema at its worst. 
	- invasion of hematogenous-derived macrophages become prominent 
	- the patient looks the worst but if they get thru, some function get better bc edema would pressure their brain .... 
	- 1-2 wks out new leaky blood vessels neovascularization form - > contributing to the edema bc they don't have a fully formed BBB - this is contrast enhancing. 
		- enhancement - more contrast media bc more circulation or leakage from the blood vessels 
	- infarcs can expand sometimes. 
	- greatest risk of dying 
- chronic 1+ mon = dmg'd tissue phagocytosis + cavitation with surrounding gliosis in brain tissue 
	- edema largely resolved bc macrophages would remove dead brain, leaving a cavity behind 
	- gliosis but no collagenous scar 
	- chronic hemorrhage in brain - they will be in the brian... see a thicker more fibroblast thing 

hemorrhagic infarc 
- start off as bland ischemic infarcts when thrombus will break off and then jam in a vessel 
- this evolves to the hemorrhagic infarc when thrombolytic system dissolves the clot -> high pressure arterial blood 
- then the arterial walls distal to that thrombus also died, so **high pressure blood will cause dead vessels ot explode**
- microscopically look same as bland infarc but except with RBCs
- clinically it's worse bc **arterial blood goes into the brain worsening edema, herniating + dying**

hydranencephaly case - abnormal flexion of neck in utero, clamping that internal carotid ... 
- infant breathed but there's something "off"
- the baby wasnt rlly crying or anything 
- eyes - sharp and **glittery** 
- no cerebral hemospheres, brainstem intact, so suckle + respiratory reflex is there 
- they live 8-9 mon before they die 
- it makes them debilitated, which is like pneumonia something else happening 
- losing cerebral hemispheres 

watershed infarcts - major 
- happen when global drop in bp for long period like someone in cardiac arrest then revived 
- involving the distal parts of areas served by major circumferential arteries... 
- in the global drop of bp, the blood's not getting ot those giga distal regions ... and watersheds are underperfused, which are areas that are meant to have circumfeerential arteries overlap 
- those places are supposed to have overlapping vessels. 
man in a barrel syndrome - these


minor watershed infarct - many minor ones at the base of cortical gyri 
- cells at the tip of gyrus but then at the sulcus those cells will disappear
- ulegyria - looks liek a mushroom sorta , causes seizures 


some neuronal populations- sensitive to hypoxia - hippocampus cell populations are different , has 4 subfields in the proper which make a neural circuit 
- neurons in sommer's sector - CA2 - **they are sensitive to hypoxia, going thru eosinophilic neuronal necrosis -> hippocampal sclerosis is the most common cause of epilepsy**
	- we can resect the hippocampus easily. 
	- short term memory stuff is fucked tho ): 
	- nowadays they'll take off the worst areas and manage rest easily 
- resistant sector CA1 
- purkinje cells - **sensitive to hypoxia, loss = > balance abnormalities**
	- they are near basket fibers, but now after they die they make empty baskets
	- this s a tombstone that tells u that purkinje cells are there 
- in the neocortex,cortical neuons in laminae III and V are sensitive to hypoxia - laminar necrosis = epilepsy 

venous infarcts - less common 
- large thrombus forming esp in the superior sagittal sinus 
- in hypercoagulant women on birth control 
- similar to watershed infarc, backing up in areas where they get cleared
- looks hemorrhagic infarc 


----
case 2 
- 60 yo htn, treated with methyldopa then loss of consciousness, fell back + hit head
- nothing bad 
	- initially - he got a subdural hemorrhage, which slides offf the surface of the brain... 
	- this is venous in origin - the **dura get torn,, the bridigng veins int he dura get torn**
	- as ppl age, their brains atrophy. but the skull stays the same ... **veins get stretched, so bridging veins can get torn easily**
	- they decomensate to some degree. but then no longer compensates, becoming evident. 
	- these can be chronic ... 
- 4 days later, severe headaches + vmiting, deteriorated right hemiplegia + l third nerve palsy , diied
- pathology - probably due to veins initiallly then the arteries later. 
- why did he rapidly deterioate in the ER? 
	-  **duret hemorrhage of the pons** - happen when brain stretches during herniation. that pressure of the blood from subdural begins to push down on skull more and more 
	- cause hippocampus to **herniate around the edge of tentorium cerebellum - this is an uncal herniation**
	- this encounters the 3rd cranial nerve 
	- ipsilateral blown pupil - stretched when brainstem begins to herniate out foramen magnum - and then the things would happen - 
	- then compresses resp centers in the **brainstem!!!!**-> shuts down and they die 
		- the small arteries would start snapping in the pons first -> making the **duret hemorrhage!!!!**


subarachnoid hemorrhage - typically arterial in origin - will be **following the gyri + sulci**
- problem with this - evolves over minutes to hours 
- this is open surface in brain and spinal cord
- very precisely - with headache in 6:30 AM or something, and **always have headache bc of nerves in meninges**
- blood breakdown - **nflammatioin in that space too**
most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhages = ruptured berry aneurysm 
- pts with htn + genetic dz that imapact strength of vessel walls 
- all over cerebellum + brain surface 
- irritation of blood breakdown -> vasospasm + new infarcts
- irritation cause dense fibrosis of meninges that traps CNS!! palsies + deafness
- fibrosis -> hydrocephalus - bc the CSF can't move normally. 
- **this is a form of chemical meningitis!!!**
in adults - they happen in the portion of circle of willis perfusing the supratentorial brain - **above the tentorium!!!**
	under a microscope - there's a natural gap bt the branches of the arteriies **gap in the arterial msucularis**
	that's why they mainly develop at arterial branch point
	the dome of these aneurysms - hard to visualize with angiopgraphy - bc the dome o thes are filled with layer blood clot 
- the issue about clamping it off and stuff - **weigh it, there's a balance of it might not ever rupturing and then the procedure might just cause a nerve palsy anyways ):**
these berry aneurysms are very common. 

---
hypertension - 
- ppl are prone to gettting spontaneous intaparenchymal hemorrhages 
- 80% in the basal ganglia, 10% in pons, 10% elsewhere
- thought to happen when **charcot-bouchard aneurysms** which are small intraparenchymal berry aneurysms rupture!!! 
- again these are at branching point 
- htn -> predisposition to lacunar infarcs... small lakes 
- htn dvelop atherosclerosis -> further out in the arterial tree so small muscular arteries 
- but malignant htn -> lose ability to regulate -> edema, herniation+ death. arterioles can no longer control them 


vascular malformation 
- AV , cavernous malformations
- capillary telangiectasias
- arteriovenous malformations are most common 
	- arteries carying high pressure -> veins which are meant for low pressure blood.. **without a feeding capillary or arteriole intervening!!!! arterioles primarily responsible for bp recall**
	- so high pressure blood -> veins, which means lots of bleeds, damaging, causing seiures etc
	- bc no capillaries, no perfusion of the brain tissues, so there's a steal phenomenon and the brain tissue die out

premies - prone to **germinal matrix hemorrhage, arterial in origin**
- these are subvnetricular region with large amt of neuroglial progenitors who are meant to make cerebrum 
- these are prone to shear injury - even slight movements of their head fuck up 
- defects with delays and white matter = can happen
