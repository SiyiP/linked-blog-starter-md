#HEENT #bugs 
tropism to the CNS - most serious 
part of the picornavirus family 
- in rhinovirus subroup - nasal + conjunctival epithelium infections via resp drops/contact - acute URIs 
- in the enterovirus subgroup: **fecal oral transmission or close contact, fomites, directly contaminated,** **viremia** + spread to CNS + muscle - super common!!!! majojrity of cases under 15 yo bc we lack antibodies when young. 
	- hmans are the natural reservoir, happens in summer/fall epidemics but year round 
	- polioviruses -  
	- coxsackieviruses - 
	- echoviruses
	- parechoviruses
	- enteroviruses 
- hep A - fecal oral transmission - viiremia + acute hep 

shedding/transmission 
ingestion -> infect intestinal epithelium + intetinal lymphoid tissues -> shed in feces
- shed from oropharynx 1-4 wks 
- shed in feces 1-18 wks 
- in tears, urine, vesicular fluid 
- **quarantine ineffective bc survive in the enviornment**
- many asymptomatic cases so many infectious pts are not identified 
- they're resistant to inactivation - naked 
	- small resistant to acid pH!!!!
	- resistant to msost disinfectants like chlorine 

at initial replication - happens in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of gi tract
- inffection -> cell death + lysis 
- +ssRNA will then docks with the membrane + extrudes genome 
- this is a msg RNAwhich **start translating the protein - onecontinuous thing ... as it folds it makes the other proteins needed.**
