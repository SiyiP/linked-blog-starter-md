tropism to the CNS - most serious 
part of the picornavirus family 
- in rhinovirus subroup - nasal + conjunctival epithelium infections via resp drops/contact - acute URIs 
- in the enterovirus subgroup: **fecal oral transmission or close contact, fomites, directly contaminated,** **viremia** + spread to CNS + muscle - super common!!!! majojrity of cases under 15 yo bc we lack antibodies when young. 
	- hmans are the natural reservoir, happens in summer/fall epidemics but year round 
	- polioviruses -  like 3 poliovirus serotypes - 
		- basically one or smth tat's big and sometimes it fades and cycles.
		- protective antibodies block that viral capsid from going into host cell 
	- coxsackieviruses - 
	- echoviruses
	- parechoviruses
	- enteroviruses 
- hep A - fecal oral transmission - viiremia + acute hep 

shedding/transmission 
ingestion -> infect intestinal epithelium + intetinal lymphoid tissues -> shed in feces
- shed from oropharynx 1-4 wks 
- shed in feces 1-18 wks 
- in tears, urine, vesicular fluid 
- **quarantine ineffective bc survive in the enviornment**
- many asymptomatic cases so many infectious pts are not identified 
- they're resistant to inactivation - naked 
	- small resistant to acid pH!!!!
	- resistant to msost disinfectants like chlorine 
- malase, fever + sore throat after 2-10 days incubation and then symptoms dissipate, then the symptoms happen again in headache + stiff neck = CNS moving!! 
	- short incubation period
	- common -veryyy concurrent infection of household 
	- asymptomatic infeciton is common too 
	- other clinical manifestations ; highly varied, cardiac inflammation too. 
- pathogenesis via **direct killing...**
- antibodies are most important for protective immunity 
best way to dectect: **RT-PCR!! of the CSF** ; too many types to do serology 

at initial replication - happens in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of gi tract
- inffection -> cell death + lysis 
- +ssRNA will then docks with the membrane + extrudes genome 
- this is a msg RNAwhich **start translating the protein - onecontinuous thing ... as it folds it makes the other proteins needed.**
- replication in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">oropharynx + intestinal epithelium primarily</mark>

poliomyelitis - poliovirus
- asymmetric flaccid paralysis = can't put weight on a foot - 
- no significant sensory loss - pinprick still detectable on that limb 
- can't move it due to motor neurons being killed 
- hematogenous spread to the tropism for CNS, cross BBB or infect peripheral nerves 
- symptoms of paralysis. anterior horn motor neurons of brainstem + SC are directly destroyed... with spinal cord in fatal polio 
- conditions for this improved with more sanitation .... in kids <15 yrs. 
	- inc paralysis risk w/ inc age. 
	- higly varibable outcome. in paralytic polio some recover over6 mos, then permenant 
but! **bulbar polio - fata, paralysis oof breathing muscles in 1 in 2k cases.**
- iron lung ): 

poliovirus vaccinations- recall 3 types of wild type poliovirus, 
type 1 - this remains 
type 2 - eradicated in 2015, last detected in india in 1999 
type 3 - eradicated in 2019 
- 2 vaccines to protect - 
- oral polio vaccine - 3 doses
	- essential for eradication of outbreaks 
	- vaccination ppl shed virus and can infect otehrs - bystander immunization too! 
	- immunity stops transmission 
	- small chance of it being vaccine-associated polio paralysis ... small chance of it reverting back into WT form 
	- phased out in 1990s bc polio fallen so far. 
- inactivated poliovirus vaccne - injected whole virus which protects against all 3 types. no shedding... cannot infect others
	- however = this cannot stop transmission of virus, can't contain an outbreak 

global - 
- if the population is under immunized, there's enough susceptible kids for **excreted viaccine derived polioviruse to circulate**
- - if it circulates 12-18 mon uninterrupted, it can mutate and then get neurovirulenc
	- these are **circulating vaccine derived polioviruses**
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	- if population's fully immunized, it's protected against spread of both wild + vaccine strains of the poliovirus </mark>
to prevent further dmg: 
	vaccinations mainly use the bivalent OPV instead with single dose of the IPV to protect against it 
	and to make sure labs and stuff which handle it are secure 
	continue to help polio survivors 

post-polio syndrome
- affects 25-50% of poliosurvivors 
- ppl can have this muscle wasting + weakness that's painful, severe fatigue, cramps 
- only symptomatic relief ): nothng else. 

nonpolio enteroviruses:
- mainly mild - uri fever mouth blisters etc. muscle aches
- again kids with asthma at risk most 
- 3 common types of nonpolio ones 
	- D68 = EV-D68
	- A71 = EV A71 
	- and coxsackie virus CV A6 
- no specific treatment  nor vaccines
- wash hands with soap and water for 20 s 

aseptic meningitis - **most common from the nonpolio enteroviruses!!!**
- acute fever + meningeal irritation but no detection of bacteria nor fungi 
- **coxsackie + echoviruses cuase like 50% of all cases**
- other causes too 
- RFs: healthcare worker, immunodeficiency, freq exposure to kids , and exposure to someone with recent viral infection 
- stiff neck, abd pain, nv, abnormal **sensitivty to light, sore throat**, 
- prognosis - recovery in 5-14 days 

myocarditis - most often caused by Coxsackie B3 
- happens during acute infection or after clearance of virus + progresses to **dilated cardiomyopathy 
- from viral cyt or immunopatology 
- EKG abnormalities or elevated cardiac enz, chest pain? 
- can have sudden death, rest is important 

h<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">and foot mouth disease</mark> - HFMD
- fever + vesicular <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">eruption over extremities + oral cavity, mainly kids </mark>
- **coxsackie virus A16 = mild**
- enterovirus 71 - **way more sever, can cause encephalitis, perm flaccid paralysis, fatal cardiopulm failure**

herpangina - **fever AND enanthem of posterioir palate, pharynx, tonsils**
- mainly mild 1-2 wks, sore throat and vesicular lesions 
- most common 3-10 yo 
- again coxsackie A and enterovirus 71 most common 

pleurodynia/epidemic myalgia /bornholm dz 
- fever with **sudden onset intense upper abdominal or thoracic pain on one sie, and headache.**
- they go to the ER worrying it's an MI or PE but nothing's found 
- coughing + breathing inc the pain 
- 3-14 days but relapses common 
- coxsackie B virus! 

generalized disease of the newborn  = enterovirus sepsis syndrome
- **echovirus 11 and coxsackie B most common**
- antenatal + perinatal infection both occur 
- death possible .... most often when onset is wtihin 15 days of birth but observed up to 90 days 
	- can have multi organ failure
	- dic, meningoencephalitis, pneumonia, 
- **similar to bacterial sepsis** = transmission in healthcare settings or caretakers. !!!
- often asymptomatic as a result 
- supportive care but rare 

myelitis = non-opolio acute flaccid paralysis  
- child <15 yrs of age 
- **asymmetrical hypotonic weakness in extremities**
- very raer tho
