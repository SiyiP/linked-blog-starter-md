#HEENT #patho 

we don't have to memorize - desmylinating conditions - no asking about anything details 

case 
previously healthy young woman 
- l facial numbness, gait imbalance, confusion + difficulty thinking 
- vision left eye impaired + vision has sense then worsened
- mri - mult enhancinglesions of optic nerves, periventricular white matter + corpus callosum 
- found in frozen section - biopsy .... we see uninvolved white pattern + sharp margin 
- **FOAMY macrophages** + reactive astrocytes 

normal appearance of white matter - typically low cellularity 
- axons 
- oligodendrocytes
- non-reactive astrocyte with large nuclei 
- non-activated microglia - 
- does NOT include: nueron cell bodies, lymphocytes, activated macrophages + reactive astrocytes, these look like stars 

perm sections of biopsy - 
- see peripvascular chronic inflammation, gliosis + large amt of macrophages
immunostains - shows
- t cells CD3 marker
- B cells CD20 marker
- mixed chronic inflamm infiltrate 
- oligoclonal bands = CSF consistent with B cells, **restricted amount of antibody clones** seen in the 
- CD68 = marcophage activated marker 

luxol fast blue - LFB-pas staining dye ; the composition of peripheral nerve myelins are diff from the ones from the CNS 
- normal CNS process - myelin stains turquoise; in the CNS or the cord. 
- in normal PNS myelin stains violet. 
- the myelin - in the stain, we see the myelin loss with occasional turquoise or residual myelinated axons + **large number of macrophages with lipid debris staining red purple**
- **if you did neurofilament immunostains - you see that most axons survived, a lt of brown!!!!**
	- axons do have a bit of dmg - **when axon is destroyed it makes axonal spheroid** - occurs when it gets broken 
- the biopsy doesn't dx a specific dz, we need clinical course 

myelin were initially normal then the disease 

immune mediated demyelinative dz 
1. multiple sclerosis / MS variants
	1. the charcot form - the most common form - relaspses + remissions of neurological distrubance with gradula accumulation of residual impairment
		1. shortens their lifes, after onset is 25 yrs 
		2. in women more than men 
		3. plaques would vary 
		4. as they age, inflammation dec, macrophages will clear + remyelination commnce
		5. however, remyelinatinon would fail due to persistent t cell and antibody responses that inhibit the oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation 
			1. glial scar formation via astrocytes 
			2. inibition of signalling cascades that let OPCs differentiate, etc 
			3. don't memorize these ^^ 
	2. less than 10% have steadily progressiv ecourse - men and women are similar, mean age is 40 
	3. acute MS - **marburg disease** - monophasic ms that is fatal in days 
	4. devic's diisease - acute MS in adults that target **optic nerves + Spinal cord with fatal destruction**
	5. balo's concentric sclerosis - rapidly fatal acute MS in kids + young adults = concentric wavelike patterns of myelin loss
	6. schilder's dz - resembles acute MS but demyelinates very large areas in cerebral hemispheres 
		1. remember this in dismylinative conditions 
	- we will have **plaques which are softening with pinkish discoloration, paler than chronic plaques**
	- usually in active plaques , white matter but some in gray matter aka cortical plaques 
	- will have demylination, axonal preservation, perivasc mononuclear cell infiltrates etc. 
	- in brain
		1. **dawson's fingers = in older plaques, it's demylination that juts out along the veins as it's entering the plaque**
		2. optic nerves, chiasm + tracts are involved in like 90% of MS patients gray gelatinous looking areas are **chronic plaques**
			1. in acute lesions - **optic neuritis sequence** 
			2. relapse - in MRI shows ehancement w/ corresponding decrease in evoked potential amplitude, indicating conduction block + vision loss 
			3. in remission - vision improoves, MRI shows loss of enhancement = inflammation stopped. evoked potentials are delayed = demylination is still present but eh conduction block is relieved. 
			4. remylination - secure conduction is restored! 
		3. also in both ascending + descending tracts in brainstem 
	- chronic periventricular plaque
		- gray gelatinous + firm 
		- noticed - plaques in **periventricular white matter + subcortically at junction of cortex and digitate white matter but U-fibers spared**
	- chronic inactive plauqes - we only see naked axons + gliosis. permenantly compromised region of the brain 
	- pathogenic basis of MS? 
		- many years - exclusively t-cell mediated autoimmune dz with myelin sheath attacked but htis is now an interplay with more and more immune factors + environmental factors? is there an infectious cause? 
		- genetics - heritability is pretty high. 
		- **HLA chromosome 6 = risk factors**!!!
		- functions of relevant genes are in adaptive/iinnate immunity + vitamin D metabolism 
		- environmental factors. - alc abuse, childhood obesity, smoking + vitamin D deficiency 
		- EBV too 
	- also this MS can interct with infiltrating b cells .... 
	- inc CSF of IgG + oligoclonal bands = earliest indicator of b cell involvement 
	- the b cells involved = make pathology by antigen presentatin, secretion of proinflammatory factors + production of neurotixc factors!!!
		- **bc of this, the most effective MS therapies are antibodies which deplete b cells!!!**
2. acute disseminated encephalomyelitis ADEM
	1. perivenous or postinfections 
	2. typically **acute monophasic** in kids + adults 
	3. develops 2-12 days post viral inffection or **immunization for rabies/smallpox**
	4. fever, headache + meningeal signs in 1 day then a decrease in consciousnes,s seizures, paraplegia, ataxia or other focal signs 
	5. rapid + cmplete recovery post 7 days 
	6. 20-30% die, with severe sequelae in similar proportion 
	7. very sleeve-like perivascular demylination , pink areas floating around the veins! 
	8. like a marble pattern! 
3. acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis  or **weston hurst disease**
	1. fatal, 1-5 days death 
	2. perivenous demylination + hyperacute form of ADEM
	3. BBB will be stopped, and then white matter has many petechial hemorrhages and is edematous 
	4. **affected necrotic small veins + cuffed by reactive macrophages mixed with neutrophils** infiltrating in brain outwards 

infectious
5. progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy PML 
	1. patchy demylination seen 
	2. happens as a complication of underlying dz processes like hodgkins disease or HIV
	3. 3-12 mon course. of visual, motor, sensory + persnality changes -> profound dementia + death 
	4. **large numbers of macrophages, smalll lymphocytes.. weird oligodendrocytes with enlarged plum colored nuclei packed with JC virus**!!!! 
	5. looks pretty big !!!
6. subacute sclerosing panencephalitis SSPE
	1. in **some** kids with early measles exposure, this is a set-up with a chronic infection in oligodendrocytes
	2. extensive demyelination that leads to death 
	3. demylination with gliosis, perivascular and parenchymal inflammation. + prominent intranuclear viral inclusion 
7. rubella - makes something similar to SSPE but lacks viral inclusion 
8. AIDS - **prent with symmetrical sensry disturbance of feet**
	1. vacuolar myelopathy  
	2. clumsiness + ataxia in weeks
	3. multifocal vacuolated + demyelinated lesions in posterior + lateral columns of spinal cord with brain spared 
	4. association with HIV infection or b12 deficiency 
genetic leukodystrophies - 
- clinical: variable, idk age of onset often the childhood 
- variety of diseases, but result in diffuse dysfunction -> vegetative state
- patho - gross demyelination -< large confluent areas wit cerebral hemispheres + other sites 
5. adrenoleukodystrophy - schilder's disease 
	1. hard to tell apart from the MS schilder's disease
	2. X linked disorder - variety of ages
	3. dysfunction of adrenal cortex, leydig cells of testis + myelin of CNS 
	4. loss of myelin in occipital, parietal and temporal lobes; **frontal cortex spared somewhat**
	5. perivascular accumulations around lymphocytes - these can be confused with MS
