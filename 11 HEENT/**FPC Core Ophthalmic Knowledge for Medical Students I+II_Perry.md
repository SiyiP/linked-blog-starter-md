orbital septum - from bone periosteum to the tarsal plate in the eyelid - key anatomical structure in differentiating preseptal from orbital cellulitis 

aqueous -> from ciliary body then flows into trabecular edges and further

eyelid anatomy 
skin, orbicularis oculi muscle, hair follicles, periofllicular glands , and **meibomian glands close to the lens area**
- **meibomian glands = tarsal glands!!!!**
---
patho
1. myopia - near-sigheed, needs - prescription ; longer eye 
2. hyperopia - far sighted - needs + prescription ; shorter eye 
3. astig = shape of eye 
4. over 40 - presbyopia - need reading glasses due to accommodation loss 
5. amblyopia - 
6. strabismus - migalignment of eyes, usually peds and follows into adulthood
	1. peds - due ot diff mechanisms, sign of smth serious like retinal dz, tumor, or any vision threatening issue or need glasses? can't focus so eyes ignored by brain so they drift; 10 years of development is huge. if 1 eye ignored , that eye will be weak . this is an **important issue to solve as a pediatric one - amblyopia is the one that follows into adulthoood as permenant weakness of that affected eye**
	2. accommodative esotropia - uncorrected farsightedness
	3. intermittent exotropia 
	4. infantile esotropia - babies show inward turning be4 6 months and glasses don't correct
	5. adults - get it from decompensated phoria(basically eyes drit from the atrophied muscles), stroke, tumor, trauma.... 
helped by glasses, prisms surgery 
hypotropia - eye down
exotropia - eyes out 
hypertropia - eye upwards 
esotropia - eyes point inward 


cranial nerve palsies - usually acquired as a result of strabismus 
- CN 6 palsy - very common - common in older adults with hypertension = 
	- we see that they can look all the way to the side, but with the R eye they can't look to the side. = CN 6 abducens. 
- CN 3 nerve palsy - **down and out.** there's ptosis to start, 
- CN 4 - see it bc the 4th nerve is super long in its course, so any head trauma is huge in older patients. 

chalazion / hodeolum 
- hordeolum = stye = infection of **gland of zeis which opens into eyelash follicle**
	- -erythema 
	- acute , concentrated around eyelash, 
- chalazion - chronic lipgranulomatous inflammation of **meibomian lgland**
	- swelling is further up as the meibomian gland is more outstretched up 
- 
	- most of the time neither is infected, but treated by warm compress, steroid creams, no antibiotics but we can use doxy , surgical drainage 

blephritis. - inflammation of eyelid margin - redness, flaking, crusting of eyelashes-
- often associated with **rosacea , itchy and irritated eyes**
- due to demodex **mites + bacteria on eyelashes**
- tREAT: hygiene with warm rinse, tea tree oil, and doxy 

dacryocystitis - 
- **nasolacrimal gland - forms from ectodermal cells at week 7.... draining teas thru the canaliculi of eyelid**
	- papilla + punctal portions of this are patent and formed. 
	- but nasal lacrimal duct system canalizes along extent simultaneously 
	- last portion to canalize = **opening to inferior meatus of nasal cavity called VALVE OF HASNER = may not open up**
	- at birth sometimes that's blocked so you get buildup near nose + eyes
	- respond well to warm compress + massage -> opens it up esp after 1st 6 mon 
- sometimes adults get that inflammation to that area = NLDS = nasolacrimal duct obstruction 
TREAT: oral empirical antibiotix, warm compress, crigler massages in kids 
- in kids resovle within 1 yr of age. 
- in adults - **dacrycystohinorectomy surgery might be needed**

preseptal vs orbital cellulitis 
- preseptal cellulitis - most common around outisd of eyes
	- infection on anterior eyelid, all **in front of septum, importnant eye stuff not involved**
	- common s. aureus + pyogenes + influenzae, pneumoniae etc. 
	- usually manage outpatient with oral antibiotics augmenten 
- orbital cellulisis - infection of orbit fat and cocular muscles 
	- deeper infection!!!
	- loss of vision + life. 
	- can be distinguisheb y eye pain, diplopia, proptosis, dec vision, pain with eye movement
	- needs CT scan around the eye 
	- common bacterial organisms causing orbital cellulitis = s. aureus 

proptosis - protrusion of eyeball due to **inc in orbital pressure/contents**
- common cause inadults = **graves dz, thyroid**
	- hyperthyroidism typically but might occur with immune induced hypothyroidism ror in absence of thryoid dysfunction = sometimes thyroid looks normal in the autoimmune case 
	- muscles get enlarged, inflammation within the eye 
	- eyelid retraction (dry eye), diplopia from inflammation, optic nerve compromise
	- treat the dry eye with lubrication but you might need orbital decompression surgery or surgeries. 
	- stop smoking , can become blind. 
- common in peds = **orbital cellulitis**
- beware of **rhabdomyosarcoma mean age 5-7 super rapidly growing tumor!**

subconjunctival hemorrage
- bruise on surface of eye 
- not dangerous, occur spontaneousy or with trauma 
- blood would j spread throughout the empty space of subconjunctiva 
- technically asymptomatic but a bit of aching 


hyphemas - more serious - trauma, tumors other causes of neovascularization, blood in the iris
- red 
- watch this closely esp after the clot forms, we don't want that clot to rebleed, ends up with blood in the anterior chamber. when there's a lot fo bloood, blocks the trabecular mesh and then cause a glaucoma by raising the pressure 
- very serious issues **inside the eye**


hypopyon 
- infectin /infalmmation - white liquid/**pus** in iris/anterior chamber
- most common - uvelitis patients can lead to this or optomytis 


hyperpurulent conunctivitis - gonococcus - 
- very severe + needs emergency treatment
- iwth **neisseria gonorrhoeae 
- may present in newborns!! transmission during delivery or sexually transmitted


adenoviral conjunctivitis - epidemic keratoconjunctivitis 
- adenovirus sr 8,4,19,37,53,54,64
- this is highly contagious spread via contact with surfaces, sharing towels, touchnig door handles
- highly contagious and no effective cure !! need relief
- can involve cornea in addition to conjunctivia - so it can cause blurriness
- topical steroids drop in severe cases but delay clerance of virus 
- povidone-iodine - used early to dec duration of disease 
- patients - shuld be follow for formtion of conjunctival membranes. membranes should be removed + we should get corticosteroids to minimize scar + symblepharon formation 


corneal abrasion - fluorescein stain 
- see fluoresent appearance abrasian in blue light 
- bavoid topical anesthetics in these instances like proparacain / tetracain !!! - **with topical anesthetic abuse, making that iris really white**

corneal foreign body 
- pts present with pain, fooreign body sensation, photophobia, blurred vision 
- superficial trauma hx , hammering metal on metal etc. 
- managed at slit lamp 
- req topical antibiotic drops
- don't give topical anesthetics 

corneal ulcer - infections
- veyr common with contact lens usage
- complete disruption of epithelial cell layer with an inflammatory response 
- don't sleep with contacts!!!!
- presenting with eye pain, hpotopobia, blurred vision 
- bacterial amoebic, viral and autoimmune 
- can be blinding, but vrey painful, treatment consists of antibiotics + never prescribe topical anesthetics!!!!

open globe injuries -
- full thickness wound to the eye
- seconday to blunt trauma, ppl who fall 
- rupture the globe
- sharp injuries too with full thickness injury ? 
- penetrating injur y- single laceration, no exit owund 
- intraocular foreign body 
- perforating injury - 2 full thickness lacerations entrance AND exit caused by same agent
- needs emergency, surgery in 24 hours. systemic antibiotics 

open globe with iris prolapse + **eccentric pupil**
- iris sticking out of eye kinda 


intraocular foreign body - always do a CT scan for a pateint with open globe injury - regardless of stated mechanism of injury/age or to the patient 
- "pretty tiny corneal wound" , no iris prolapse, bleeding etc. 
- but if there's open globe injury always do the cT scan bc you would see a pencil tip in the ciliary sulcus or some foreign body possible!!

disclocated lens 
- can be a result of trauma, or some spontaneous event like in Marfan's homocystinuria, weill-marchesani syndrome, Ehlers danlos syndrom or familiia ectopia lentis 
- requires surgery 
- lens can fall to back of eye or front of eye 

eyelid lacerations
- managed diff due to 
- depth of injury, width and location 
- anyone with a canaliculi injury we require opthalmic care 

burns of eye - ocular adnexa
 - thermal - tissue dmg from thermal **burns quickly ablates once heat energy is no longer in contact with patient **
 - most ppl don't en up with terribl burns bc of blink reflex but 
 - can see treatment with steroids, careful management iwth scarring/contractures
- chemical injuries - more serious, alkali most dangerous, all chmical injuries should be irrigated + these alkali burns can destroy **limbal stem cells to cornea = permentnat vision loss**
	- very rapid injuries . 

orbital blowout fractures
- any trauma can result in this 
- the nasal body wall and stufff is very thin - a blowout fracture is protected while the bone gives away 
- hypoglobus 
- and these pts can sometimes have the muscle slip thru the boney fracture and get caught 
- when these heal without getting dealt with, the eye sitting lower = double vision. 

pterygium - wing shaped fold of conjunctia and fibrovascular tissue which invades superficial corneal layers
like part of the iris is worn away with conjunctiva 
can result in corneall astig or occlusion o visual axis
benign but can be blinding, happens with light exposure, surfers eye

cataracts - if you live long enough 
- cloudy lens happen gradually early changes in 50s , and then 60s/70s
- age related 
- blurry, not correctable with glasses/contacts. worsening glare when driving at night, hard with contrast, blurry vision for all. 
- surgery to remove them = most common surgry in the US 

watch a cataract surgery video in opthamalogy 

posterior pole anatomy - 
- we can't see the back of eye with our direct opthalmascope - bc it's super magnified 
- we see optic cup, optic disc, 
- macula - bt the 2 arcades of vessels

glaucomas - optic nerve damage due to usually pressure
- cup to disk ration = **greater than the normal. the cup might be super big** , "cupped out, patient is blind" when u lose that entire rim 
- instead of vessels curving out over nerve, they curve in edge of nerve rim 

1. primary open angle glaucoma POAG - most common, pen, normal appearing anterior chamber and raised intraocular pressure with no other underlying disease
	1. first loss peripheral vision then closes in 
	2. secondary glaucoma - if thre's underlying raised IOP cause. 
	3. normal tension glaucoma - if IOP is within normal limits
	4. treated with eyedrops, lasers, or surgery in early times. 
	5. we see ciliary body, iris, anterior chamber, etc. **flow of fluids**
2. angle closure glaucoma - 
	1. something's pushing all that **iris forward and the ciliary body down and laterally!!!**
	2. when angle is closed the **trabecular meshworm's blocked, and then we can't make fluid flow, so we get acutely elevated pressures**
	3. this is rare cause - medications in anticholinergic agents
	4. acute angle glaucoma - **very rapid!! and brow ache, very sudden and painful**
	5. laser treatment, meds, etc. 

papilledema - swollen optic nerves have many causes,,, but htis specifically refers to **optic nerve**
- we see rim big and vessels not there
- if it's **swollen BECAUSE of inc INTRACRANIAL pressure (due to mass, dural venous thrombosis, idiopathic intracanial htn)**
- see swollen nerve, just describe it as optic nerve swelling until you know the etiology of why it's swollen. 

retinal tear + detachments
- flashes of light, floating spots. 
- **shadow in vision that gradually encroaches centrally**  - fluid got underneath retina + beginning to get detached 
- requires dilated eye exam. 
- sometimes treatable in office with laser when caught early, may req surgery 
- relatively an emergency 

uveal melanomas
- dilated exam to check very rare
- malignant tumor from melanocyts in uveal tract like iris, ciliary body or **choroid usually**
- strong metastasis esp to liver... poor prognosis when it's like that 
- choroid = common site 
- RFs = sporadic, risk factors: light iris, light skin, ability to tan, north European ancestry 
- rarely family hx of this can predispose 
- pre-existing choroidal nevi are small risk too 
- some genes - GNAQ, GNA11 bAP1 SF381 , EIF1AX
- treat - plaque radiotherapy to map out tumor location + proton mbean therapy , enucleation 


retinoblastoma - huge 
- most common intraocular malignancy for kids 
- young kids< 4 
- germline or somatic - both happen 
	- **bilateral with germline**
	- unilateral mostly = **somatic mutations**
RB1 tumor supressing gene mutation 
- knock out both copies of that
- supposed to make Rb which targets E2F family TFs. 
- 2 hit factor for knock out!!! loss of heterozygosity!!
- if first mutation is germline they have heritable retinoblastomas - 
- autosomal dominant **high penetrance!!!**
- first and 2nd RB occur somatically - more treatable if only in 1 eye 
-tereat: chemo, plaque radiation, and sometimes surgery/enucleation 
- white reflex instead of red reflex in kids 
	- note u might get a white reflex if you catch te optic nerve too so make sure 
- **florettes diagnostic of this**


inherited retinal dystrophy - retinitis pigmentosa most common 
- many heterogenous disease gene mutations
- **nyctalopia - night blindness loss of rods**
- losing peripheral + central vision 
- problems with color vision 
- RP caused by defect in RPE65 gene can now be treated with medication... voretigene neparvovec-rzyl - injected under retina, in childhood, and new/: = fyi 

macular degeneration 
- very common issue , with adults
- dry or wet
- many have dry variety that doesn't involve neovascularization!!!but wet = dmg to retina then the BV growth from choroidal area into subretinal space 
- TREAT: antioxidant vitamins - AREDS2: dry AMD, anti-VEGF for wet AMD. injections into the eye 
- central vision impact


retinal embolism 
- hollenhorst plaque
	- white cholesterol plaque travels all the way up into the retinal vasculature and gts stuck 
	- indication - **ipsilateral carotid dz, plauqe can even come from proximal vessels like aortic arch**
	- sometims this happens wthout ischemic event 
	- symptoms = **transient monoocular vision losss/dec in vision + future stroke risk. 
	- many causes of *<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">*amaurosis fugax = transient monocular vision loss..</mark>.. = darkness like a shade drooping down and when it lifts up (blood supply restored)*** this is a differential. *
	- workup: carotid dopplers + Echo 

- central retinal a occlusion - more extreme vers of retinal embolism 
- - somethng actually gotten blockd due to the thing 
- **retinal wwhitening with cherry red spot at fovea!! no nerve fiber layer**
- fovea = red there! since there's no nerve fiber layer ... this looks red in comparison to the swollen entire retina 
- 95% are non-arteric; **clot or cholesterol moved there**
- 5% temporal + giant cell arteritis. or other inflammation disrdrs 
- severe loss of vision
- RFS: 40+ , htn, hypercholesterol, diabeets
- can happen in younger ppl with collagen vascular dz, hypercoagulopathies, cardiac vascular dz 
- stroke workshop - carotid imging, cardiac imging 

central reetinal vein occlusion - hemorrhages everywhere, vein blocked, venous stasis blood not draining 
- diabetes, htn, inc age, hyperhomocysteinemia + factor V mutation.. 
- other causes can be open angle glaucoma , CRVO in 1 eye, 
- ischemic or nonischemic 
- need nonVEGF injections, the surgery etc

diabetes - nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy 
- most common cause
- well controlled = better
- NPDR = early stage marked by leakage, no new bvs, microanuerysms, exudates, hemorrhages, and then nonproliferatve = less dangerous, leaky bvs.... no visual deficit unless macular region fills ith fluid 
- need to refer all newly dx diabetics for eye exam non-emergent 

proliferative diabetic retinopathy 
- difference - enough dmg to the bvs that we see ischemia inside, so new bv growth = dangerous
- we see neovascular fromes, which leak and stuff and are weak walls, making scar tissue destroying the retina 
- we need treat - pan-retinal laser photocoagulation - this will make s many laser spots that kill peripheral retina and takes away vegf production 

acute htn 
- cotton wool spots - microinfarc of retinal nerve fiber layer caused by fibrinoid occlusion of nutrient arterioles - close to optic disc, vision not impacted by these 
- optic disc edema - diastolic above 120 mmhg, acute problem
- we nly manage their bp 

chronic htn 
- moderately sustained htn at least 5 yrs stffens all + narrows lumen of arterioles. we can tell 

carotid a stenosis - ocular ischemic syndrome
- due to chronic insufficient eye perusion from severe intrnal carotid a stenosis 
	- anterior segment cell = flare
	- cataracts
	- splotchy mid-periphery intraretinal hemorrhages
	- anterior + posterior segment neovascularization -> neovasc glaucoma
	- vitreous hemorrhage
- eye pain 
- vision loss
- amaurosis fugax
- red eye, 
- will get big stroke 

hiv disease
- cotton wool spots - represent antigen antibody complexes causing microinfarcs
- cmv retinitis can be signed by this 
- cmv retinitis with low cd4 counts need quick treatment

endophthalmitis - open globe injuries - intracular purulent inflammations, serious, and stuff
- exogenous - spreading into the eye from surgery, injections, corneal ulcers, trauma
- endogenous - bacterial fungal endogenous chorioretinitis like spreading from heart valve 
- need antibiotics or surgery 

herpes zoster ophtalamicus - V1 distributon might involve eye
- will get invovlement with the eye surface
- upper eyelid + forehead
- hutchinson's sign = tip of nose blister = **nasociliary br of v1!!!!!!**
- if they have that blister there careful of checking their cornea
- acyclovir + steroids 
- dendrite seen in the lens light.. characteristic of herpes 
- V2 - zoster on cheek + lower lid = their eyes are usually fine 

giant cell / temporal arteritis - systemic inflam vacular syndrome of older
- optic disc infarc 
- sudden painless vision loss, limb girdle myalgias, stroke, jaw claudication 
- 15% with polymyalgia rheumatica get this 
- elevted sed rate, CRP, llow platelets, etc = all not specific
- **biopsy of temporal artery is the only definitive thing**
- high dose steroids + long term management tocilizumab
- temporal headache, darkening of vision that comes back
