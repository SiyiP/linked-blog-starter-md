<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">foveation</mark> - movement of eyes so foveas of both are aimed at common point of interest 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">both foveas do fixation = on actual obj</mark>
	-<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> saccades = ballistic type movements to survey/fix eyes on common interest - there's shift between points of interest for that fixation to actually take place. </mark>
type of eye movements
- saccadic - scanning, fast ballistic to find the target location + change, 200 ms latency 
	- rate is constant 
	- duration depends on distance moved. 
	- **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">conjugate</mark> eye movement s- moving <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">simultaneous in same direction</mark>**
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">smooth</mark> pursuit - tracking, target vector, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">watching river flo</mark>w 
	- slower tracking movements, requires moving obj 
	- speed **matches target speed**
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">to establish this we need saccadic eye movement initially</mark> -
	- need light inputs
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">disconjugate</mark> = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">vergence</mark> movements - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">opposite direction mving </mark>
		- convergence + divergence 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">vestibuloocularmotor</mark> - stabilizing,<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> head acceleration</mark>
	- work together with optokinetic eye movements to stabilize urself relative to external world, compensating for head movements wth the semicircular canals
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">medial vestibular nucleus</mark> -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ascending fibers to aid in that head movement stabiization </mark>
	- optokinetic <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">nystagmus</mark> - **alternatng of saccades and slow pursuit** lke looking <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">at patterns movng </mark>, lookng at tree after tree after passing them 
		- mix; saccades + slow pursuit for patterns! 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">vergence</mark> - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">changing target distance, as it moves aways, u diverge and when it comes close, you cross</mark> - basically convergence and divergent gazing!!!!!!
there's ocular motor neuclei 
- oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens 

extraocular muscles - 
- rectus moving in a cross superior nf, temporal, medial 
- and the obliques for rotations 
	- superior olibque intorsion , medially and down; SUP is IN  
	- inferior oblique extorsion , roll it out, up and lateral. 

![[extraocular muscles innervation chart.png]]

superior oblique = trochlear CN 4 = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">contralateral</mark> superior oblique muscle 
lateral rectus = abducens nerve - 

ocular motor nerves
- start with CN 3 = oculomotor nerve
- from the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">oculomotor nucleus in the dorsomedial aspect of midbrain </mark>
- will be more medial = motor = medial 
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">CN 3 exits brainstem at **interpeduncular fossa!!!** -> </mark>
- innervates **ipsilateral superior, inferior , and medial rectus**
- in the more caudal midbrain, the **trochlear nucleus** which is medial in the brainstem exits on the **dorsal surface** -> **crossing to innervate the contralateral superior oblique msucle = only thing is to rotate nasally** intorsion - 
- pontine medullary junction - has the abducens nucleus = on the **pons** -> ventral side and goes to innervate **ipsilateral lateral rectus muscl**
	<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">- **recall the oculomotor , trochlear and abducens nuclei all communicate via the medial longitudinal fasciculus -</mark>** 
	trochlear = the only contralateral thing

reviews of patho
1. CN 3 oculomotr nerve palsy : triad
	1. affected eye only move down and out (due to intorsion and unopposed lateral movement)
	2. dilated pupil + **unresponsibe to light**; no constriction 
	3. eyelid droop bc the levator muscle is also innervated by CN 3 
	4. **double vision can exist with ANY other CN related to this area related to movements** 
	5. caused by diabetic neuropathy, hypertension, head trauma shearing nerve, aneurysms - like bt the postrior cerebral and suprior cerebellar 
2. trochlar n = innervation of **superior oblique**
	1. eye affected is more extorted, upward gaze - up and out. 
	2. presents with tilting of head away from affected eye to balanc field of view 
	3. causes: head trauma, diabetes, aneurysms 
	4. cerebellar tumors can make it worse bc of it being close to the vermis 
3. abduces n palsy 
	1. horizontal diplopia - affected eye not able to move well, slightly medial drift
	2. affected eyes don't abduct 
	3. pateitn has slight head turn to affected eye 
	4. head trauma, infection, aneurysms, inflammation 

control of horizontal cnojugate eye movements = helps u move from l to r
- require coordination - motor nuclei, cortical gaze control areas(cerebrum, frontal eye field), MLF (oculomotor nuclei communication) and superior colliculus (integrate eye movements)
	- medial rectus - CN 3 
	- lateral rectus CN 6 
	- MLF = will connect **horizontal gaze control center = paramedian pontine reticular formation on the dorsal surface of brainstem, inferior to the abducens nucleus!!!** with many nuclei 
		- visual info -> contralateral/R superior coliculus -> opposite side/L PPRF , which will mean it's all coordinated movement to the left 
	interneurons - between ipsilatera L abducens nuc to the abducens nerve -> L rectus muscle 
	- **it does in addition : sending contralateral/R information to contralateral occulomotor nucleus to medial rectus of R eye!!!** so it can also move tot he left!!!
if you lesion .... 
- R abducens nerve -> eye ... Right eye can't move to the lateral side right lateral rectus can't be pulled 
- right abducens nucleus - turning left is fine with the left eye. turning right to the left is fine bc **the leftward gaze is controlled by the left abducens nucleus**. but the **left eye can't move to to the right....nothing going to the left oculomotor and the right eye can't do it either!!**
	- right lateral gaze palsy - neither eye moving to the right due to nucleus taken offfline 
- taking the right PPRF offline 
	- eyes both can move to the left
	- n<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">either eye can move to the right bc it controls the ipsilateral horizontal movement...</mark> 
- specific lesion<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> bt L MLF.</mark>.<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"></mark>. connecting that **abducens nuc to the contralateral/R occulomotor nucleus**
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">L eye moves to left</mark> bc **not impacting abducens** and right eye moves to the L **bc the MLF on the R is still intact**
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">R eye still moves to the R bc abducens not impacted.</mark> 
	- L eye **can't move t the right bc the L medial rectus can't contract due to severed nerve between the R abducens nucleus + L oculomotor!**
	- internuclear opthalmoplegia = the unaffected eye also has nystagmus .... maybe other abducens nerve tries to compensate 
- left MLF and L abducens nucleus - both ofline!
	- basically L eye can't move to left. so R eye can't moves to L bc the L MLF can't send contralaterally to the oculomotor 
	- R eye can move to the right bc abducens on R is fine. but the L eye can't move bc the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">MLF which connects the R abducens to the L rectus </mark>
	- 1 1/2 syndrome = only half of the function of 2 eyes in place. 
vertical gaze control 
- superior + inf rectus and sup + inf oblique
- CN 3 + CN 4 
- rostral midbrain reticular formation - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">RMRF = close to the oculomotor nuclei and trochlear nuclei </mark>
	- more dorsal = upward control gase
	- more ventral = downgaze control 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">MLF will interconnect VGC and HGC together. </mark>
we don't go as in depth. 
superior colliclulus - **contralaterally activate the other side of the gaze center!!**
	taking in integrations of visual, auditory, tactile information to organize eye and head movements to fixate on objects!!!!
	like turning away from an explosion! instead of towards like ppl do with harmless sounds 
	- **tectospinal tract allows superior colliculus to direct head movements to match eye movements**
		- from the tectum = > in the superior coliculus, **controlateral projection town thru the VENTRAL column posture control** to coordinate head neck movements


CN2. = contralateral visual field into the superior colliculus 
- what happens in superficial layer - visual information coming in 
	- visual info will activate interneurons 
	- fires with new movement 
- stratum opticum - optic tract axons - takes in tactile + auditory information whch will combine with the superficial purely visual information and
- deep layer sends information out via motor layer to aid in saccadic eye movements 

cortical input is huge too 
 injury to frontal eye field = in frontal lobe = injury = inability to make saccades to contralateral side + deviation of eyes to the side of lesion 
parietooccipitotemporal area - ipsilateral pursuit movements - transient? 

these are transient bc frontal eyefield sends 2 projection = one to the superior colliculus and one bypassing it to go straight to the PPRF...
- still some control of saccadic eye movements in spite of this
