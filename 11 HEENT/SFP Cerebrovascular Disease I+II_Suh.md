strokes
- rapid onset of neuro symptoms bc of lack of blood supply - 
	- clogged vessel = ischemic  ; the majority = 
		- we see early changes: **asymmetrical changes!!!**
		- blurring of lentiform nucleus, loss of gray white differentiation in the insula = insular ribbon sign + effaceemnt of cortical nulcei. 
		- hypodensity in the R cerebellum - symmetry - "what's different?"
	- rupture vessel = hemorrhagic 
		- intraparenchyma hemorrhage = inside brain
			- seen **edema dark gray around the hemorrhage , of a white color = intercerebral hemorrhage. anything light on the Ct scan**
			- when blood goes into deeper location. - can cause **blockage + hydrocephalus bc of CSF blockage...**
			- with this blockages, our vessels get smaller and smaller... so more and more of the blood vessels can't handle the blood and get mini aneurysms = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">charcot-bouchard aneurysms</mark>
			- often hypertension associated bleeds typically in deeper location = thalamus, basal ganglia, pons , cerebellu, due to charcot-couchard aneurysms 
		- lobar subcortical = superficial
		- putaminal hemorrhage, most common 
		- thalamic hemorrhage
		- pontine hemorrhage
		- cerebellar hemorrhage 
	- subarachnoid hemorrhaage - **this white thing that was bleeding from that.. not actually within the brain.** light areas of blood surrounding the brain. 
		- can see "star sign or hanging chickn sign"
		- we see **intraventricular blood as well as near the bottom of the brain where gravity's pulling it**
		- most common due to TRAUMA!!! but iin ICU = this is ruptured aneurysms is the biggest cause
		-  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">vasospasm + delayed cerebral ischemia is maor complication. one type of med is **nimodipine** for better outcomes!!!!! </mark>

	- hemorrhagic strokes - intracerebral + subarachnoid hemorrhages are huge
	- epidural + subdural hemorrhages are usually separate bc of the extrnal forces needed to cause these bleeds = **these are NOt strokes**
		- epidural - due to **injury in middle meningeal artery** - rapid expansion 
		- subdural - due to injury of bridging **veins** - **slowly expanding bleed...**  bc it's a vein 
		- treat for both - surgical 

TIA = transient ischemic attack - any neuro deficit resolving in 24 hrs without any dmg clinical or radiographic 
- some ppl call it "ministroke" meh 
CV prevalence of this 

types of edema - which one's caused by stroke 
- vasogenic- typically ppl with tumors 
	- inc. vessel permeability and fluid accumulation outside of brain cells leads to this 
	- vasogenic = a type of brain edema resulting from an **accumulation** of **extracellular fluid due to disruption of the blood brain barrier.**
	- caused by trauma, inflammation, tumors   
- cytotoxic - caused by stroke! basically **cells no longer hold gradient and bursts and dies off**
	- this is due to ionic gradient alterations! 
	- this is caused by the failure of ATP-dependent transport of sodium and calcium ions across the cell membrane, causing accumulation of water and swelling 
- hydrostatic
- osmotic 
risk factors
- htn 
- hyperlipidemia
- smoking
- obesity
- diabetes 
- prior stroke
- obstructive sleep apnea
- polysubstance
- coronary artery dz 
- a-fib = chance of clot via non rhythmic beats 

nonmodifiable RFS
- genetics like sickle cell
- sex. - being in females
- age higher than 55 

stroke symptoms
BEFAST = for the public 
- balance issues/sudden headache/dizziness
- eyes - blurred vision
- face droop 
- arms weakness/numbness
- speech abnormalities
- time
very specific symtpoms!!!!
left v right 
language -> housed on the **left side**!!! sorta lateral... 
	MCA left responsible for this 
neglect -> housed on the **right side**
side -> contralateral side motor control, basically r controls eft and vice versa 

anterior v posterior 
ACA- medial  ; frontal  ; **legs> arms**
MCA- lateral side ; temporal and some parietla  ; **arms>legs**
	think of your sensorimtor cortex tbh with the legs hanging over that medial cliff 
PCA - occipital , vision + memory !!!
Basillar - cerebellum + brain stem ; deficits there ; coordination 

how to assess patients
- always ABC
- airway 
- breathing 
- circulation
vital signs
and NHSS stroke score - just know it exists. higher = worse it is 
goal - to localize + ask which region of concern and which vessel supplies it 

anterior circulation 
- MCA 
	- contralateral visual field loss, weakness , sensory deficits in arm more 
	- gaze to the side of infarc 
	- **Left MCA = aphasia in dom hemisphere**; language issues seen ; 
		- wernicke's aphasia- trouble understanding but can talk pretty well. this is the **inferior division of the left MCA**
		- brocas - can't make speech = this is more frontal lobe **superior division of the left MCA**
	- R MCA = neglect in nondom hemisphere neglect 
- ACA 
	- language stuff mess = apraxia , abulia, akinetic mutism
	- contralateral weakness + sensory defcits in **leg**> arm 
	- cog/personality changes due to frontal lobe
	- hugely weakness in leg of the contralateral side. 
- ICA = mixture of both MCA/ACA ; thanks to the atnerior comm/posterior comm of the circle 

posterior circulation 
- basillar - impaired level of consciousness, locked in syndrome
	- basically posterior comes off and the anterior spinal artery too 
	- highly packed area of the brainstem. 
	- consciousness, all the centers. 
- cerebellum
	- ataxia, coordination issues + off balance
- brainstem injury - 
	- medulla, pons, and midbrain
	- level of consciousness, CN involvement
	- crossed sgns, like ipsilateral face but contralateral body 
- PCA - 
	- contralatreral homonymous hemianopia, weakness, sensory deficit - bc it gives off brs to the thalamus
	- deeper structure that its involved with is the **thalamus - so we lose that visual cortex n the contralateral side**
	- charles bonnet syndrome
		- **complex hallucination of shapes/figures/objs, and patient retains insight abt them being false** 
	- anton syndrome 
		- cortical blindness, and patient will confabulate details meaning **they don't recognize the fact that they can't see** 
- AICA-  anterior inf cerebellar a
	- CN 7/8 defcit 
	- lateral pontine syndrome 
		- ipsilateral limb ataxia, **loss of ipsilateral pain/temp in face,** facal weakness+hearing loss/vertigo with **contralateral loss of pain+temp of body** 
		- ![[pain pathway of face.jpeg]]
- PICA- posterior inf cerebellar 
	- lateral medullary syndrome 
		- ipsilateral hemiataxia, **horner's syndrome** + loss of pain and temp of face with loss of pain +contralatral loss of pain+temp of body 
		- **hiccups and hoarseness**
- ASA - anterior spinal artery ; at that cervical medullary junction 
	- medial medullary syndrome - very low in the brainstem. 
		- ipsilateral **tongue** weakness + contralateral body weakness/sensory loss 

watershed zones
- due to poor perfusion from severe hypotension 
- farthrest area for blood to reach ... 
- man in a barrel syndrome 
	- weakness in upper extremities, can't move arms, can move face and legs tho. guy in a barrel. 
	- this maeks sense we got upper extremity weaknes,s bc the MCA does have to travel a lot to give lateral side some love, which is why the upper extremities are impacted 

cortical deficits - more superficial - more complex things like language
subcortical deficits. - more deep - more simple things liek motor and sensory ; like thalamus, basal ganglia etc.

know in workup
- when was the last known normal? 
- we need glucose lab before we give thrombolytics
- getting a non-contrasted CT head scan bc it's faster. 
- most common finding = a normal scan 
	- just looking for early signs of ischemia with loss of gray white diff/effacement seen asymmetric changes remember
	- and hemorrhge beng white 
	- **hyperdense sign = unilteral hyperdensity of some proximal vessel which can be seen.... when a thrombosis is present within the lumen... basically this shit is still white even tho we didn't give any contrast**
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">for ischmic strokes</mark>
	- also spot sign - some contrast leaking out, a hemorrhage when seen .... the contrast goes thru vessels and then leaks out in these - huge in hemorrhages, where there's focal extravasation of this inside the hematoma . increases risk of having the hematoma worsen. 
		- for intracranial hemorrhage 
- also look at CT angiogram - looking at vasc to look for occlusion 
- and CT perfusion looking for tissue at risk 

after the acute phase 
- MRI brain img eventually post-thrombolytic administration 
- and lab workup 
- cardiac testing too 
TOAST criteria 
- large vessel atherosclerosis 
	- blockages happen in large vessels due to atherosclerosis most common, dissections, giant cell arteritis 
- small vessel occlusion 
	- typcally - **lacunar infarcts, DEEP IN BRAIN**
	- subcortically - in putamen, caudate, thalamus, etc
	- caused by lipohyalinosis - due to medial hypertrophy + lipid admixed with fibrinoid material most often from long htn 
	- microatheroma blockage  
- cardioembolism
	- afib common cause 
	- multiple sites, many territories get ischemic!!! 
- stroke of other etiologies - liek with medicaitons making blood thicker 
	- sickle cell anemia 
	- ppl with DVTs. 
	- hypercoagulatble stuff
	- hypotension - in watershed area stuff 
- stroke of undetermined etiology 

treatment - what are our optons ? 
- penumbra - tissue at risk if nothings' done. 
	- basically area at risk of dying = gray areas
	- blue areas = infarcted core = dead tissue we can't do anything about 
- perfusion - CT scans to find it 
in acute treatment 
- thrombolytics = **symptom onset has to be within 4.5 hours**
	- recall we need glucose. 
	- very safe; the tPAs. 
	- alteplase-> tenecteplase transition happens , no big difference 
	- won't give if there's a hemorrhage on their scan. 
	- **note about counting hours = someone has to notice them and remark that they're normal. this isn't when they get their symptoms necessarily.**
- mechanical thrombectomy - 
	- last known normal within 24 hours... 
	- can also get this even tho it's recent. 
	- this is for big clot regardless. 
med: **nimodipine = for subarachnoid hemorrhage **

secondary prevention  - use these esp with ppl who get TIAs
- antiplatelets; plavix clopidogrel, statins , warfarin 
	- used majority of time , unless they cardioembolic
- anticoagulation -used in the TOAST criteria, if it's **cardioembolic instead!!!!!**
- statins
