#HEENT 


source = photon of light ; instead of intensity it's brightness ... compared to auditory 
change in pressure for hearing 

properties of transparencies of cornea and lens and pupil (controls amt of light)

ciliary body - accomodation = changes the bend (round or flat) to focus light close up or far away 
- how nervous system focuses the light to keep it together and keep it from scattering to focus it on the most sensitive parts. 
- trying to **focus on a close point =**, lens is more rounded... 
	- **relax the zonules/suspensory ligament by contracting the ciliary body**
	- think - round... **we need to contract ciliary muscle**
- trying to focus on a far point = **lens is more FLAT!!!.**
	- the ciliary zonules need to pull it taut , **so we need to relax the ciliary muslce as a result**
	- think Far = Flat lens 
- presbyopia = loss of lens accommodation with age = controled by the ciliary body... 

2 primary divisions - anterior + posterior duh 
3 key layers
- fibrous sclera 
	- opaque - posterior 85% of the eye
	- irregular collagen fibrils = **opaque**
- choroid vascular 
- retinal / neural layer 
cornea - **transparent,**
- due to the **orientation of collagen fibers being regular**
- key part = stromal layer 

iris 
- controls how much light goes thru pupil by contracting/relaxing
- sphincter pupillae parasympathetic m contraction dec pupil size 
- sympathetic = will dilator pupillae will inc pupil size when contracted 
- why contraction is antagonistic of each other - fibers orthogonal and perpendicular 

pupillary light reflex - reflexive autonomic control controls how much light goes thru 
- light enters the eye -> retina activates optic nerve
- synapse in the pre-tactile area = **has connections to the edinger westphal nucleus**, the motor nucleus which activates
- CN 3 which will contract the eye making it smaller 

ciliary body - + suspensory ligaments 
- ciliary muscle fibers
- ciliary epithelium - makes **aqueous humor.** , purfusing the area and **goes thru canal f schlemm**
- ciliary zonules = **same as the things attached to ciliary processes and to the lens = something that tethers them together**
	- they ar part of the process to round or flatten 
disturbance of this body = > no aqueous humor = **inc intraocular pressure + glaucoma**

 we should bend the light in transparent things to get the best retinal signal... 
 glasses work well bc i't sadditive, inc lens in power. 


refractive ERRORs
1. emmetropia = typical - it's fine. 
2. hyperopia = farsightedness; it's more **round lens.** so we make that point show up behind the retina... 
3. myopia = nearsightedness = looking at far field, focal point is in front of retina .... 
4. astigmatism = this is by scarring or dmg in the lens that **cause hte eyes to scatter instead of focus**
	1. there is **no focal point of the light, we loost control of its shape and following**

retina = fundus camera img 
- fovea = black spot there - super dense, bc it's **packed with photoreceptors, most photosensitive in the eye! best acuity , they **absorb light instead of reflecting**
- macula - the dark aura around the macula 
- optic disk = a white part, without a dark dot bc you have n axons moving thru 

signal processing in retina
- ![[Screenshot 2025-10-22 at 11.01.52 AM.jpeg]]
light enters from bottom up, and that information needs to get all the way back into the photoreceptor layers, the the light is passed as a structure to the nerve fiber layer to exit
- pigment = **for us to have that protection and prevent them from having so much cells bounc around**
- pigment epithelium 
- pooto receptor layer - outer and inner nuclear portion 
- outer plexiform layers - bipolar + terminal of photoreceptrs fist bump \
- inner nuclear layer - ell bodies of bipolar layer. 
- inner plexiform - where the processes of the nerves in ganglion layer connect with eachother = 
- convrted into bipolar cells -> which communicate with retinal cells 

achromatic = rods,but very sensitive to light, **low acuity bc not as widespread, located peripheral + macula**
cones = low light sensitivity, only in bright light but source of colo  vision 
- high acuity, concentrated in the fovea 

back of retina - the optic disk - no rods nor cones
fovea = way more cones than rods

visal sensitivity range - very wide
- luminence - number of photons 
- scotopic range= where only the rods which are most sensitive area involved= this is like walking w friends at night. 
- cone threshold -> both cones and rods are active: **metopic range**
- photopic range = max best sensitivity - but still . 
- rods = high sensitivity 
- cones = range where its most activ = most sensitive?? 

S-cone , M-con, L-cone = **so many parts of cones wihch allow it to essentially have specific ocolorful ones for whatevs**
but for the **rods, we have rhodopsin, which is our specific only one **


pathology 
1. trichromats - normal vision 
2. dichromatis - missing one grp of photopigment like in nammals. 
	1. basically you're **losing a specific cone pigment**
3. monochromatds - don't see colr, can't distinguish 

photopigment activation 
- activation of photopigemnt = > actvation of all ther signals. , the structure changes!!!
	- for vitamin A, light isomerizes 11-cis-retinal chomophoreof photopigment to all-trans retinal as an active intermediate ->this lead to cascade of rxns leading into cGMP channel closure 
- note - **this is irreversible!!! photopigment activation will need to be regenerated.**
	- this is why vitamin A def = blindness
	- if no vitamin A/all-trans retinol, we don't replenish 11-cis retinal

effect of light... the pathway 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">in dark = **photoreceptors are DEPOLARIZED, poz membrane potential, high lvls of glutamate are released!!!!**</mark>
- basically the cGMP are open 
- K+ efflux , Na+ influx 
confirmational change aka activation of the photopigment : cGMP quantity decreased!!! from the confirmational change 
- basically, **the cell's K+ efflux which is always on is not being balanced by Na+ influx, so cell hyperpolarizes in the light**
- low glutamate release! 

this is critical for - **contrast/luminance detection**
- contrast bt light + dark must be delineated immediately. 
- process of EDGE detection: 
in DARK
- the photoreceptor is active , releasing glutamate
- glutamate received by **bipolar cells**
	- off-center bipolar cells = **excitatory AMPA and kainate glutamate receptor,, DEPOLARIZED, firing!!!!!**
	- on-center bipolar cells = **inhibitory metabotropic, hyperpolarized, NOT responding**
- off-center retina ganglion cell have excitatory glutamate receptors AMPA, Kainate, NMDA -> **activate that glutamate, depolarize, in the dark.**

in LIGHT: 
- the photoreceptor is inactive , not release glutamate
- glutamate not much received... by **bipolar cells**
	- off-center bipolar cells = excitatory AMPA and kainate glutamate receptor not receiving much... 
	- on-center bipolar cells = **inhibitory metabotropic, hyperpolarized will be firing off glutamate*** , they are **DISINHIBITED**
- on-center retinal ganglion cell have excitatory glutamate receptors AMPA, Kainate, NMDA = **we know we're in the light on-center**

3 main types of ganglion cells
- many flavrs - in addition to being on or off center... we have many morphologies!
- ultimately they project in different pathways 
1. "midget"/little 
	1. small , small receptive field + high acuity = **for very fine details**
2. "parasol"
	1. large, large  receptive field but low acuity = changes in luminance, often like **motion** 
3. K ganglion cell 
	1. small , large receptive field, **connected to cones obligatory, so they do color**

intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells!!!
