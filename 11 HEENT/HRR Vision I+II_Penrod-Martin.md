#HEENT 


source = photon of light ; instead of intensity it's brightness ... compared to auditory 
change in pressure for hearing 

properties of transparencies of cornea and lens and pupil (controls amt of light)

ciliary body - accomodation = changes the bend (round or flat) to focus light close up or far away 
- how nervous system focuses the light to keep it together and keep it from scattering to focus it on the most sensitive parts. 
- trying to **focus on a close point =**, lens is more rounded... 
	- **relax the zonules/suspensory ligament by contracting the ciliary body**
	- think - round... **we need to contract ciliary muscle**
- trying to focus on a far point = **lens is more FLAT!!!.**
	- the ciliary zonules need to pull it taut , **so we need to relax the ciliary muslce as a result**
	- think Far = Flat lens 
- presbyopia = loss of lens accommodation with age = controled by the ciliary body... 

2 primary divisions - anterior + posterior duh 
3 key layers
- fibrous sclera 
	- opaque - posterior 85% of the eye
	- irregular collagen fibrils = **opaque**
- choroid vascular 
- retinal / neural layer 
cornea - **transparent,**
- due to the **orientation of collagen fibers being regular**
- key part = stromal layer 

iris 
- controls how much light goes thru pupil by contracting/relaxing
- sphincter pupillae parasympathetic m contraction dec pupil size 
- sympathetic = will dilator pupillae will inc pupil size when contracted 
- why contraction is antagonistic of each other - fibers orthogonal and perpendicular 

pupillary light reflex - reflexive autonomic control controls how much light goes thru 
- light enters the eye -> retina activates optic nerve
- synapse in the pre-tactile area = **has connections to the edinger westphal nucleus**, the motor nucleus which activates
- CN 3 which will contract the eye making it smaller 

ciliary body - + suspensory ligaments 
- ciliary muscle fibers
- ciliary epithelium - makes **aqueous humor.** , purfusing the area and **goes thru canal f schlemm**
- ciliary zonules = **same as the things attached to ciliary processes and to the lens = something that tethers them together**
	- they ar part of the process to round or flatten 
disturbance of this body = > no aqueous humor = **inc intraocular pressure + glaucoma**

 we should bend the light in transparent things to get the best retinal signal... 
 glasses work well bc i't sadditive, inc lens in power. 


refractive ERRORs
1. emmetropia = typical - it's fine. 
2. hyperopia = farsightedness; it's more **round lens.** so we make that point show up behind the retina... 
3. myopia = nearsightedness = looking at far field, focal point is in front of retina .... 
4. astigmatism = this is by scarring or dmg in the lens that **cause hte eyes to scatter instead of focus**
	1. there is **no focal point of the light, we loost control of its shape and following**

retina = fundus camera img 
- fovea = black spot there - super dense, bc it's **packed with photoreceptors, most photosensitive in the eye! best acuity , they **absorb light instead of reflecting**
- macula - the dark aura around the macula 
- optic disk = a white part, without a dark dot bc you have n axons moving thru 

signal processing in retina
- ![[layers of eyeball and retina.jpeg]]
light enters from bottom up, and that information needs to get all the way back into the photoreceptor layers, the the light is passed as a structure to the nerve fiber layer to exit
- pigment = **for us to have that protection and prevent them from having so much cells bounc around**
- pigment epithelium 
- pooto receptor layer - outer and inner nuclear portion 
- outer plexiform layers - bipolar + terminal of photoreceptrs fist bump \
- inner nuclear layer - ell bodies of bipolar layer. 
- inner plexiform - where the processes of the nerves in ganglion layer connect with eachother = 
- convrted into bipolar cells -> which communicate with retinal cells 

achromatic = rods,but very sensitive to light, **low acuity bc not as widespread, located peripheral + macula**
cones = low light sensitivity, only in bright light but source of colo  vision 
- high acuity, concentrated in the fovea 

back of retina - the optic disk - no rods nor cones
fovea = way more cones than rods

visal sensitivity range - very wide
- luminence - number of photons 
- scotopic range= where only the rods which are most sensitive area involved= this is like walking w friends at night. 
- cone threshold -> both cones and rods are active: **metopic range**
- photopic range = max best sensitivity - but still . 
- rods = high sensitivity 
- cones = range where its most activ = most sensitive?? 

S-cone , M-con, L-cone = **so many parts of cones wihch allow it to essentially have specific ocolorful ones for whatevs**
but for the **rods, we have rhodopsin, which is our specific only one **


pathology 
1. trichromats - normal vision 
2. dichromatis - missing one grp of photopigment like in nammals. 
	1. basically you're **losing a specific cone pigment**
3. monochromatds - don't see colr, can't distinguish 

photopigment activation 
- activation of photopigemnt = > actvation of all ther signals. , the structure changes!!!
	- for vitamin A, light isomerizes 11-cis-retinal chomophoreof photopigment to all-trans retinal as an active intermediate ->this lead to cascade of rxns leading into cGMP channel closure 
- note - **this is irreversible!!! photopigment activation will need to be regenerated.**
	- this is why vitamin A def = blindness
	- if no vitamin A/all-trans retinol, we don't replenish 11-cis retinal

effect of light... the pathway 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">in dark = **photoreceptors are DEPOLARIZED, poz membrane potential, high lvls of glutamate are released!!!!**</mark>
- basically the cGMP are open 
- K+ efflux , Na+ influx 
confirmational change aka activation of the photopigment : cGMP quantity decreased!!! from the confirmational change 
- basically, **the cell's K+ efflux which is always on is not being balanced by Na+ influx, so cell hyperpolarizes in the light**
- low glutamate release! 

this is critical for - **contrast/luminance detection**
- contrast bt light + dark must be delineated immediately. 
- process of EDGE detection: 
in DARK
- the photoreceptor is active , releasing glutamate
- glutamate received by **bipolar cells**
	- off-center bipolar cells = **excitatory AMPA and kainate glutamate receptor,, DEPOLARIZED, firing!!!!!**
	- on-center bipolar cells = **inhibitory metabotropic, hyperpolarized, NOT responding**
- off-center retina ganglion cell have excitatory glutamate receptors AMPA, Kainate, NMDA -> **activate that glutamate, depolarize, in the dark.**

in LIGHT: 
- the photoreceptor is inactive , not release glutamate
- glutamate not much received... by **bipolar cells**
	- off-center bipolar cells = excitatory AMPA and kainate glutamate receptor not receiving much... 
	- on-center bipolar cells = **inhibitory metabotropic, hyperpolarized will be firing off glutamate*** , they are **DISINHIBITED**
- on-center retinal ganglion cell have excitatory glutamate receptors AMPA, Kainate, NMDA = **we know we're in the light on-center**

3 main types of ganglion cells
- many flavrs - in addition to being on or off center... we have many morphologies!
- ultimately they project in different pathways 
1. "midget"/little 
	1. small , small receptive field + high acuity = **for very fine details**
2. "parasol"
	1. large, large  receptive field but low acuity = changes in luminance, often like **motion** 
3. K ganglion cell 
	1. small , large receptive field, **connected to cones obligatory, so they do color**

intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells!!! 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">- not only can photoreceptors on their own respond well to light but these do too!!! and can change how they act based on light </mark>
- small % of these exist, **contains <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">melanopsin</mark>, in the retina, intrinsically light sensitive**
	- this is huge for **non-image forming light functions , like things we're unconscious about like circadian entrainment , changing hormones, sleep reg, reflex circuits**

---
neural output from the retinal ganglion cell axons -> optic nerve -> optic chiasm etc. some portions cross.. 
they go to hypothalamus  for circadian rhythms 
and **pretectum which connects to edinger westphal reflex control**
and superior colliculus - for orienting the movements of head + eyes (saccades etc)

but image making pathway -> **to synapse int he LATERAL geniculate nucleus!!! LGN**

in contrast to the auditory system's synapsing nucleus being the medial geniculate nucleus! MGN [[HRR Auditory System I+II_Penrod-Martin]]

so from the LGN... axons of cells in thalamus -> will give out the optic radiations or axons -> striate cortex 

visual field information  + retinal fields
we need a coherent map of all img-making lights! 
visual field in relation to retinal fields. 
- define the 4 quadrands as:
	- superior
	- inferior
	- temporal = lateral to eye 
	- nasal = close to the nose 
- binocular visual field = the middle or near the middle of the 4 quadrants... meaning both eyes see it
	- key reason we cross at chiasm - keeping that information together. retinotopy !!! 
- **monocular porition of visual field** = meaning j one eye sees this information 
- - when we make that same img we see in the retina, it's upside down !!!! 
	- **superior retinal field -> inferior field**
	- AND!!! temporal switches with nasal fields!!! like a flip and then another flip the other way  
different points of each retina - which portions of the field are we sampliing??
- monocular portions = extreme lateral portions of the field like temporal-wise 
	- **these are being detected by the extreme edge of nasal retina** of the ipsilateral eye.... 
	- R visual field in **biocular version -> sampled by the ** temporal retina of L eye, Nasal retina of right eye
	- L visual field in binocular region -> 
		- sample by the L eye nasal retina 
		- and the R eye temporal retina 
- axons that reflect that same location is physically separated... 
- we need axons to reflect that same visual space together... 
![[visual to retinal field location.png]]
to keep the topographic visuals kosher, all the axons that carry information in one location are together. 
- retinotopy is maintained in L + R and upper lower!!!
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	- nasal retina **axons in one eye need to meet up with the temporal retina axons from the other because they are reflecting the same spac!!!**</mark> - this is for the **binocular areas**
- optic radiations will terminate in superior and inferior visual cortex!!! depending ... 
	- radiations exiting the **lateral geniculate nucleus coding for superior** retina / lower  visual field in the actual world -> to superior visual cortex 
	-  **lateral geniculate nucleus coding for** inferior retina aka upper visual field in the actual word -> inferior visual cortex, which is closer to the back of head 

more on the **optic chiasm**
- temporal retina / lateral + nasal retina have distinct field representation
- so that tempora retina of one eye + nasal of other eye **must overlap to make a full field**
- this is done by **crossing at optic chiasm...**
- important diagnostically look into the lesions 
1. lesion of optic nerve b4 chiasm: monocular deficit = all info from **one eye lost**; no depth perception 
2. lesion at chiasm : **bitemporal / bilateral deficit**; info lost from both fields 
3. lesion post-chiasm - homonymous deficit, meaning same portion of field is gone in both eyes 
![[optic chiasm crossover.png]]

- in the case of post-chiasm lesions, if we lesion one side / red side post-chiasm, we get lack of red in both eyes visual field! 

LGN - of the thalamus - 
- at that point on either side of brain - we only have one portion of information from the visual field, but also axons from different eyes. 
- they are organized in the LGN by which eye it's coming from. 
- layers 1-6  - each layer **getting axon from one eye or the other... no layer will get axons from both eyes**
- different types of retinal ganglin cells terminate on sublayers and each other layer of the LGN. 
- **highly organized by still isolated - information isn't mixed yet.** retinotopy still maintained 

optic radiations maintain that retinopathy - with : 
- superior retinal quadrants -> superior visual cortex 
- fibers representing inferior retinal quadrants. 
	- inferior path = **the meyer's loop, inferior retinal field aka superior visual field**
	- if only the inferior portion's cut: contralateral homonymous superior quadrantanopia = 
		- we lose one quadrant of the visual field to contralateral visual field. 
1. if both dorsal and ventral are cut off on one side or hemisphere of brain... you lose 1 half of your visual field, the same on both sides opposite side of dmg. 

calcarine fissure - separate inf + superior visual cortex!!! 
**now striate cortex** 
- binocular portion of visual field + monoocular portion as well 
	- binocular portion on the inside folds? 
- upper and lower visual field 
this is also in layers; defined by projection + input patterns 
fibers coming from LGN 
sublayers too all organized 
- K ganglion cell / konocellular input - synapse in layer 2/3 
- parasol + midget - termination in 4C of the cortex 
main idea - **as u terminate in the striate cortex, we have a map but no integration yet!**
- once we're **in** the cortex, we make cortical columns, within the cortex beyond the layers..
- we record via electrodes, in a vertical straight line. = cells in this position = shares a receptive field + tuning properties of lines + edges

striate cortex - orientation selectivity 
- we got portions of every visual field where we have cells that are sensitive to EVERY orientation to make a complete img. 

striate cortex - binocular input: 
- input from layer 4... inside the cortex we finally combine monocular + binocular!!
- **ocular dominance columns, from this portion on, there's a column that's strongly monocular favoring one eye then strongly binocular and so on, like ur making stripes!**
- now you have a range of cells = **portions that are more sensitive to binocular and others that are more sensitive to monocular**
- ocular dominance column that's only sensitive to contralateral eye input next to a column of equal input sensitivity next to column only sensitive to the ipsilateral eye ! 
- this grading is huge for **depth perception**
1. amblyopia = condition where u have imbalance of information given by the 2 eyes -> permenant reduction in effectiveness of one eye to drive cortical neurons - worse binocular vision and ocular dominance columsn flop 

orientation selectivity - 
- 

hypercolumns - don't worry about this 
- orientation colummsn and cular dominance columns are overlaid to make hypercolumns of cells
- this type of crosstalk is super ipmortant - a blend of every orientation and position = to really reflect being able 

-
streopsis - depth perception 
- it's still slightly offset in spite of the binocular stuff in the columns 
- this makes depth!!! based on binocular disparities 
- objs in front or behind fixation point will be in slightly diff positions on the 2 retinas 
- amblyopia - reduces acuity due to pathological plasticity from prolonged ocular dominance imbalance -> depth perception 

extrastriate cortex - secondary areas 
- know that diff visual processing thigns are in diff extrastriate pathways
- ventral what stream - V1->V2->V4 (**temporal lobe**) = info about color. obj identity on size, shape color 
- dorsal where stream V1-> V2 -> middle temporal level , **parietal lobe** -> selective fr motion, position, direction 

visual disturbances
1. negative phenomenon- loss of info like lesions
2. poz phenomenon - added info, like visual hallucinations in ventral stream, or rando ligts
3. look into location in field
4. monocular or biocular 
![[lesions along the visual pathways.png]]
any cuts to any of the **optic radiations or myers loop = produces contralateral superior quadrantopia or iferior quadrantopia**


"macular sparing lesion"
- fovea having a larger rep for its size at all levels of the visual system
- **so even with lossing in visual field u get the sparing of the macula aka cetner of field**
- note the MCA + PCA can still give collateral flow to macular area of primary visual cortex
