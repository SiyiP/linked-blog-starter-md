hypothalamus- smaller part of diencephalon, but smaller
- edge of mamillary bodies, which are hypothalamic nuclei 
- region rostral to optic chiasm = preoptc area 
- caudal end = merges with central gray and reticular formation of midbrian tegmentum 
- defined by the medial edge of internal capsule 

has 12+ nuclei!
maintians homeostasis
regulaton of bp + electrolyte compo, body temp, energy stores via feeding and metabolsm, and reproducton + emergency stress
pituitary gland - attached to this, release many hormones 

this gets contextual information from **cerebral cortex + amygdala + hippocampus** and sensory of all kinds : 
- will send out **visceral motor, somatic motor, neuroendocrine, behavioral responses!!!!**
sends information to mammilary bodies for memory formation control over all other motor systems 

selectively choosing which nuclei to talk about 
they are all aggregated dorsal to the pituitary nuclei 
- clusters that are more medial - more discrete borders + **more influence on hormonal production bc situation over that pituitary gland**
- lateral nuclei - more disperse but next to the **medial forebrain bundle of fibers**, which will have more impact on viseral motor systems, -> reticular areas -> reticular areas of brainstem

hippocampus -> sends information thru the fornix -> mammillary bodies!  -> mammothalamic tract output -> anterior thalamic nucleus in the thalamus 

mammlillary bodies -> mamlllotegmental tract sends info to the -> tegmental area of the midbrain for -> connect to reticular areas for visceral motor responses 

preoptic areas in the lateral hypothalamus inside the hypothalamus = seria medularis fiber bundle connect these. 

amygdala emotional center -> seria terminalis -> medial basal nuclei of hypothalamus associated with hormones
amygdala -> will send informaton to the more lateral nuclei thru the ventral amygdulofugal fibers-> ventral forebrain 

interconnection of forebain + the brainstem nuclei 
- via the medial forebrain bundle 

anterior to posterior nuclei list: 
1. preoptic areas : 3 nuclei but don't have to differentiate
	1. has sexually dimorphic nuclei - erection, t release etc in men. so it's bigger in size
	2. regulate body temp with anterior hypothalamus 
		1. basically works with the anterio hypothalamus, which is posterior to the preoptic area - they're close
		2. inc of body temp or pyrogens -> stimulate the preoptic area -> via anterior hypothalamus -> output into the peripheral vasodilation sweating etc to cool off
		3. preoptic area -> **posterior hypothalamus** - for when it's too cold; -> **deactivate the preoptic area** -> activation of posterior hypothalamus -> peripheral vasodilation , shivering, inc tissue metabolism. heat conservation 
		4. other region that input to the preoptic ara: the septal nucleus, which gets vasopressin and helps regulate fevers to start the cooling offf phase of the body 
	3. neurons secrete regulaors of gonadotrophin secretion 
2. suprachiasmatic nucleus
	1. above the optic chiasm 
	2. input from retinal axons abt light
	3. outputs do entrainment of circadian rhythm to the light cycle 
	4. **sends via the superior cervical gangliion connection to pineal gland alters the melatonin secretion**
	5. animals who hibernate has larger suprachiasmatic nucleus
	6. older adults have issue with sleep bc the pineal gland would calcify, so melatonin isn't as released. 
mid-rostral slice - tuberal region 2 
3. anterior hypothalamus - thermosensors 
	1. endogenous core temps + peripheral input 
	2. promotes thermal dissipation w preoptic area
4. paraventricular + supraoptic nuclei - 
	1. sits closer to midline
	2. magnocellular neurosecretoy - very visible + big
	3. axons end on capillaries of posterior pituitary 
	4. secretion of oxytocin SM constraction + vasopressin / ADH regulation in kidney water function 
	5. these regions are quite large ... 
	6. these will send axons down to the **more posterior region of pituitary**
5. anterior pituitary 
		1. parvocellular neuroendocrine neurons secrete regulatory peptdes into capillary plexus
		2. these portal vessels carry peptides/NTs ot the capillary plexus in anterior primry 
		3. regulation of the GH, LSH etc. 
	8. tuberal nuclei -> will send iinformation directly to anterior pituitary to regulate hormones + sexual behaviors. 
	9. these are small celled 
6. tuberal region 3, mid-caudal slice
	1. will still see both the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei 
7. ventromedial + lateral nuclei - feeding behavior 
	1. destroy the ventromedial = obesity 
	2. if you stimulate the Ventromedial = stop eating. 
	3. lateral area destructoin = starvation 
	4. Destroy LH = startvation, and stimulate LH. = inc eating. 
	5. altered sensory info (GI receptors -> mechanoreceptors) , altered set point(starved guy), altered sensory information 
	6. eat -> inc glucose -> Ventromedal hypothalamus -> satiety -> eating stops -> dec in blood glucose -> lateral hypothalamus turned on... 
feeddback cues
- short term - regulated in a meal like circulating glucose back t the hypothalamus  , GI peptides, mechanoreceptors 
- long-term cues - regulate overaall body weight. 
	- leptin in fat cells-> to hypothalamus -> expressed in fat cells -> bind to leptin recptors 
- also eruglation of diff nucleus
	- - apply glaanin in PVN inc fat ingestion
	- apply opiates in PVN protein ingeston 

posterior slide/caudal
- posterior hypothalamus - higher up to promote thermal conservation body 
- mammillary bodies - input from hippocampus, output to anterior thalamic nucleus 

limbic system 
hippo campus - starting point 
- sending via fornix up and arund it and into mamillary bodies 
- mammillary body projects to anterior nucleus of thalamus
- anterior thalamic nucleus projects to cingulate gyrus 
- gingulate gyrus connect to hippocampus via cingulum bundle 

histamine - tuberomammillary nucleus - this is found here, does promote behavioral arousal 

hypothalamus - integrates autonomic , endocrine, motifvated
