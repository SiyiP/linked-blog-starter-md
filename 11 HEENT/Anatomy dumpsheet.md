1. superficial midline incision chin to jugular notch 
2. horizontal cut along body of mandible from chin to immediately anterior to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ear</mark> lobe. 
3. horizntal cut from anterior to ear lobe, arching superiorly to the external occipital protuberance. 
4. incision along superior border of trape muscle from external occipital protuberance to acromion process if not made in block 10 
5. incision from jugular notch along clavicle to acromion process anterolaterally ![[del later - neck removal.png]]
preserve platysma muscle on at least one side 0: be careful!!!

6. see that it covers the antrior triangle and lower portion of posterior triangle of neck. 
7. near clavicle - lift inf border of this - **near midline of neck.**
8. free vessels + nn from deep surface of it + reflect superiorly leaving it attached to insertion along mandible body 
9. we see underneath - the sternocleiomastoid m anteriorly, trapezius m posteriorly, and the clavicle inferiorly = posterior triangle border
![[del later. platysma.png]]

10. id the external jugular v in the superficial fascia deep to platysma m 
	1. this is superficial to the sternocleiomastoid 
11. follow this down and see that it **pierces investing layer of deep cervical fascial above clavicle**
12. nerve point of neck? has cutaneous nerve brs of cervical plexus - midpoint of posterior border of sternocleimastoid m 
13. follow 4 cutaneous brs as they pass thru the posterior triangle of neck to enter superficial fascia... 
	1. C2 = lesser occipital nerve along posterior border of SCM as it passes superiorly going to the area posterior to ear - 
	2. great auricular nerve C2,3 crossing superficial surface of SCM going to area **anterior to ear**
		1. runs parallel to the external jugular vein 
		2. supplies the skin over carotid gland, lower portion of ear, 
	3. transverse cervical n C2,3 passing transversely across SCM and on top of the internal jugular v? , but sometimes this is removed w/ platysma - supplies skin over anterior triangle of neck. 
	4. supraclavicular nerves C3,4 passing inferiorly towards clavicle - 3 branches, medial, intermediate and later please preserve!

14. ID CN 11 crossing the posterior triangle deep to deep cervical fascia
15. isolate this from surrounding CT 
16. follow to see it piercing SCM and trapezius 
17. id small portion of subclavian a + v crossing most inferior of posterior triangle  - seen greater in the next dissection/: 
	1. like the "floor" of posterior tirangle 
	2. subclavian vein anterior to subclavian a 
	3. recall - external jugular will drain into this subclavian v 
18. id transverse cervical + suprascapular aa crossing floor of posterior triangle at inf end as they pass to the back. - seen greater in the next dissection/: 
	1. transverse cervical a has superficial + deep br 
	2. superficial transverse cervical -> trapezius 
	3. deep br of transverse cervical AKA dorsal scapular a -> levator scapulae + rhomboid major + minor 
	4. suprascapular a - after crossing posterior triangle floor supplies supraspinatus + infraspinatus muscles
