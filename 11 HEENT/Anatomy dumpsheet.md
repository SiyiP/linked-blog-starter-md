1. superficial midline incision chin to jugular notch 
2. horizontal cut along body of mandible from chin to immediately anterior to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ear</mark> lobe. 
3. horizntal cut from anterior to ear lobe, arching superiorly to the external occipital protuberance. 
4. incision along superior border of trape muscle from external occipital protuberance to acromion process if not made in block 10 
5. incision from jugular notch along clavicle to acromion process anterolaterally ![[del later - neck removal.png]]
preserve platysma muscle on at least one side 0: be careful!!!

6. see that it covers the antrior triangle and lower portion of posterior triangle of neck. 
7. near clavicle - lift inf border of this - **near midline of neck.**
8. free vessels + nn from deep surface of it + reflect superiorly leaving it attached to insertion along mandible body 
9. we see underneath - the sternocleiomastoid m anteriorly, trapezius m posteriorly, and the clavicle inferiorly = posterior triangle border
![[del later. platysma.png]]

10. id the external jugular v in the superficial fascia deep to platysma m 
	1. this is superficial to the sternocleiomastoid 
11. follow this down and see that it **pierces investing layer of deep cervical fascial above clavicle**
12. nerve point of neck? has cutaneous nerve brs of cervical plexus - midpoint of posterior border of sternocleimastoid m 
13. follow 4 cutaneous brs as they pass thru the posterior triangle of neck to enter superficial fascia... 
	1. C2 = lesser occipital nerve along posterior border of SCM as it passes superiorly going to the area posterior to ear - 
	2. great auricular nerve C2,3 crossing superficial surface of SCM going to area **anterior to ear**
		1. runs parallel to the external jugular vein 
		2. supplies the skin over carotid gland, lower portion of ear, 
	3. transverse cervical n C2,3 passing transversely across SCM and on top of the internal jugular v? , but sometimes this is removed w/ platysma - supplies skin over anterior triangle of neck. 
	4. supraclavicular nerves C3,4 passing inferiorly towards clavicle - 3 branches, medial, intermediate and later please preserve!

14. ID CN 11 crossing the posterior triangle deep to deep cervical fascia
15. isolate this from surrounding CT 
16. follow to see it piercing SCM and trapezius 
17. id small portion of subclavian a + v crossing most inferior of posterior triangle  - seen greater in the next dissection/: 
	1. like the "floor" of posterior tirangle 
	2. subclavian vein anterior to subclavian a 
	3. recall - external jugular will drain into this subclavian v 
18. id transverse cervical + suprascapular aa crossing floor of posterior triangle at inf end as they pass to the back. - seen greater in the next dissection/: 
	1. transverse cervical a has superficial + deep br 
	2. superficial transverse cervical -> trapezius 
	3. deep br of transverse cervical AKA dorsal scapular a -> levator scapulae + rhomboid major + minor 
	4. suprascapular a - after crossing posterior triangle floor supplies supraspinatus + infraspinatus muscles

face scalp parotid region 
note - skin is very shallow 

1. shallow vertical incision apex to naison inferiorly 
2. midline incision inferior  

id + clean parotid duct crossing lateral surface of masseter muscle located on lateral aspect of face, near angle of mandible

blunt dissect parotid duct anteriorly as it crosses the anterior border of masseter muscle to pierce buccinator as it turns medially into cheek 
try to id the margin of hte parotid gland following it posteriorly 
parotid sheath - the CT 

---

buccal br of facial = anterior margin of parotid gland ... runnign parallel to the parotid duct

buccal brach follow into the parotid 
alternatively rflect the gland 
- this will begin the parotid plexus  

follow the parotid plexus out and up for temporal branches 
id temporal br toward periphery as it crosses zygomatic arch 
id the zygomatic br crossing that zygomatic bone **between temporal + buccal br**
- like the cheekbone ball looking thing 

id the mandibular br running parallel to the mandible inf to the buccal br 
- this crosses over the facial artery 

cervical br as it crosses angle of mandible ot ener the neck 
- inferior to mandibular branch - innervation of the **platysma muscle**

the nerves all converge into the facial nerve deep at the earlobe !!! 

BVs of face + scalp 
- tortuous facial a from deep to submandibular gland + crosses inf border of mandible 
- facial vein = posterior to facial artery as it crosses inf border of mandible superficial to submandibular gland 
- superficial temporal a = terminal br of external carotid, running anterior to ear + to the scalp 
	- supplies the temporalis m 

id: thin frontalis muscle deep to skin of forehead
id and clean orbicularis oculi muscle encircling eyelids 
id and clean zygomaticus - from the zygomatic arch to angle of mouth 
clean orbicularis oris m superior + inf portions circumerence around oral cavity 


supraorbital? - br of opthalmic division V1 as it passes thru supraorbital foramen deep to frontal occipitofrontalis belly 
- reflect portion of frontalis muscle up top .... 


infraorbital n = br of maxillary V2 as it passes deep to levator labii superioris m 
- this exits the infraorbital foramen witht the vessels
- this is deep to the levator labii superioris 

mental nerve - br of V3 mandibular as it exits mental foramen deep to depressor anguli oris muscle 
- must transect this muscle to see it 
- 

buccal nerve V3 on lateral buccinator muscle as it **emerges deep to masseter ...**
- 

auriculotemporal nerve V3 from posterior to parotid gland crossing superiorly over posterior zygomatic artch + anterior to external acoustic meatus
