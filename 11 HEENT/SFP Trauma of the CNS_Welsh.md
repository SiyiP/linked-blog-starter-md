scalp - will make a diff in protecting ur skull 
linear types of fractures 
laceration - 
1. basilar skull fracture - across base of the skull - **racoon eyes, blood in ear, orbital regions or some csf leak**
	1. blood from the ear is suspicious
2. epidural hematoma - we see a blood pushing into the brain more inside, we get a lenticular shape 
	1. mostly in younger ppl 
	2. lucid interval - conscious and fine and then just crumple on you, high flow bc it's arterial 
	3. 2. temporal skull fractures - cause meningeal artery rupture - arterial hematoma - epidural hematoma - usually middle meningeal artery 
	4. compression/flattening of **adjacent gyri + displacement of brain - possible herniation + death**
3. subdural hematoma - underneath the dura so spread out on top of the brain - like a **cresent moon shape**
	1. they are older ppl due to brain atrophy, bridging veins with more pull on them and more tendency to rupture
	2. hitting skull or falls down this can happen . 
	3. unilateral more frequently... + bilateral happens tho 
	4. morbidity - 5% rebleed with chronic subdural hematomas... altered mental status + maybe focal neurological deficits
	5. mortality is high in acute 
	6. flatten gyri maybe. mainly stuck on dura - the blood. 
4. childhood non-accidental trauma ): 
	1. bilateral subdurals happen in little kids - blood going interhemisphericc - parafalcine 
	2. globe hemorrhage - in optic nerve + eye 
	3. bone fractures - with different age 
	4. subarachnoid hemorrhage more tendency 
	5. more likely to get **massive edema... warping of white matter looks like it increased**
	6. unmyelinated brain more likely to tear due to lack of myelination 
	7. herniations with the brain going into posterior fossa, tearing the bvs off brainstem -> midline hemorrhage
5. chronic traumatic encephalopathy - repeated episodes of trauma or single blast inury in soldiers
	1. transient symptoms arly on 
	2. **intraneuronal tau inclusions** = these are like dementias, traumatic degeneration 
		1. different than alz, some overlaps . 
		2. **dementia pugilistica - from boxing. we see atrophy + tangles, large ventricles , hydrocephalus in a vacuum.**
			1. the brain tries to expand out to the edges of skull to make sure the bridging veins don't pop
			2. **we get tangles seen in the cells - similar to alzheimers**
			3. 2 seperate leaflets are supposed to be down midline, but these can get a cavum instead
	3. concussions will damage the brain - CTE 
6. diffuse axonal injury - shear injury with inertia in car crash
	1. basically stretchng + shearing nerve cell processes in white matter ; head impact isn't required 
	2. 1/2 of all primary intra-axial traumatic brain lesions - usually severe closed head injury - loss of consciousness, diffuse + bilateral -> primary cause of vegetative state
	3. basically corpus callosum, periventricular areas, brainstem white matter tracts get super dmg'd 
	4. we see tearing of penetrating BVs too - many small hemorrhages and tearing seen 
7. remote Difffuse axonal injury - if they survive + going into vegetative state
	1. you just end up with hemosiderin laden orange macrophages, loss tissue. 
	2. cavum too 
	3. not specific path - just tissue loss = pale from loss of processes!!! 
8. acute DAI- axonal swelling - retraction balls, axonal tearing seen 
	1. silver stain - see axonal swelling and big gray balls 
	2. amyloid precursor protein is seen in the brain , **which stains the swellings too**
9. contusions - bruises!!!
	1. seen on outside of brain 
	2. superficial foci of punctate or linear hemorrhages along gyral crest
	3. caused by brain running into skull or dura 
	4. on scans - see blood, superficially see some dripping into the sulci. bright areas. 
	5. seen on autopsy, it's blood on frontal + most likely temporal tips. 
	6. subarachnoid hemorrhage associated mainly 
	7. **contre-coup damage = when u get hit by an obj , you get the sku**
