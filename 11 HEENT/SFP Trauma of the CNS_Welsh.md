scalp - will make a diff in protecting ur skull 
linear types of fractures 
laceration - 
1. basilar skull fracture - across base of the skull - **racoon eyes, blood in ear, orbital regions or some csf leak**
	1. blood from the ear is suspicious
2. epidural hematoma - we see a blood pushing into the brain more inside, we get a lenticular shape 
	1. mostly in younger ppl 
	2. lucid interval - conscious and fine and then just crumple on you, high flow bc it's arterial 
	3. 2. temporal skull fractures - cause meningeal artery rupture - arterial hematoma - epidural hematoma - usually middle meningeal artery 
	4. compression/flattening of **adjacent gyri + displacement of brain - possible herniation + death**
3. subdural hematoma - underneath the dura so spread out on top of the brain - like a **cresent moon shape**
	1. they are older ppl due to brain atrophy, bridging veins with more pull on them and more tendency to rupture
	2. hitting skull or falls down this can happen . 
	3. unilateral more frequently... + bilateral happens tho 
	4. morbidity - 5% rebleed with chronic subdural hematomas... altered mental status + maybe focal neurological deficits
	5. mortality is high in acute 
	6. flatten gyri maybe. mainly stuck on dura - the blood. 
4. childhood non-accidental trauma ): 
	1. bilateral subdurals happen in little kids - blood going interhemisphericc - parafalcine 
	2. globe hemorrhage - in optic nerve + eye 
	3. bone fractures - with different age 
	4. subarachnoid hemorrhage more tendency 
	5. more likely to get **massive edema... warping of white matter looks like it increased**
	6. unmyelinated brain more likely to tear due to lack of myelination 
	7. herniations with the brain going into posterior fossa, tearing the bvs off brainstem -> midline hemorrhage
5. chronic traumatic encephalopathy - repeated episodes of trauma or single blast inury in soldiers
	1. transient symptoms arly on 
	2. **intraneuronal tau inclusions** = these are like dementias, traumatic degeneration 
		1. different than alz, some overlaps . 
		2. **dementia pugilistica - from boxing. we see atrophy + tangles, large ventricles , hydrocephalus in a vacuum.**
			1. the brain tries to expand out to the edges of skull to make sure the bridging veins don't pop
			2. **we get tangles seen in the cells - similar to alzheimers**
			3. 2 seperate leaflets are supposed to be down midline, but these can get a cavum instead
	3. concussions will damage the brain - CTE 
6. diffuse axonal injury - shear injury with inertia in car crash
	1. basically stretchng + shearing nerve cell processes in white matter ; head impact isn't required 
	2. 1/2 of all primary intra-axial traumatic brain lesions - usually severe closed head injury - loss of consciousness, diffuse + bilateral -> primary cause of vegetative state
	3. basically corpus callosum, periventricular areas, brainstem white matter tracts get super dmg'd 
	4. we see tearing of penetrating BVs too - many small hemorrhages and tearing seen 
7. remote Difffuse axonal injury - if they survive + going into vegetative state
	1. you just end up with hemosiderin laden orange macrophages, loss tissue. 
	2. cavum too 
	3. not specific path - just tissue loss = pale from loss of processes!!! 
8. acute DAI- axonal swelling - retraction balls, axonal tearing seen 
	1. silver stain - see axonal swelling and big gray balls 
	2. amyloid precursor protein is seen in the brain , **which stains the swellings too**
9. contusions - bruises!!!
	1. seen on outside of brain 
	2. superficial foci of punctate or linear hemorrhages along gyral crest
	3. caused by brain running into skull or dura 
	4. on scans - see blood, superficially see some dripping into the sulci. bright areas. 
	5. seen on autopsy, it's blood on frontal + most likely temporal tips. 
	6. subarachnoid hemorrhage associated mainly 
	7. coup injury = when u get hit by an obj , you get the skull fracture, scalp bruise etc on the same place, it all lins up 
	8. **contre-coup**  = major dmg is in the front, and you fall backwards, so the contusion is in the back, the base of your skull. 
		1. the skull hits floor, then the brain would bounce up and rub against the frontal bones
	9. old contusions look very orange, flattened gyri + stained with hemosiderin 
	10. **gliding contusions - happens along the midline**
		1. basically brain is staying put in the falx. 
		2. kinetic brain injury - angular acceleratiion tears the bvs. near te midline as the falx is tethered
		3. also hemorrhagic! acute = many blood, and subacute = macrophages. in remote = cystic 
10. intracranial hematomas 
	1. blood ends up in the internal capsule, blood ends up inside the brain basically 
	2. frequently we see many combinations of things. we combine the story of things 
11. brainstem hematomas - some traumatic some not 
	1. htn hemorrhages happen here too 
	2. midline hemorrhages = **herniation of brain** 
12. fat embolism 
	1. the brain can hemorrhage petechial ones mostly in white matter due to this. 
	2. femur long bone fracture -> basically fat will go into the brain 
	3. seen in lungs too 
	4. bv obstruction - they hemorrhage. 
13. cord lesions- trauma, and some ppl fracture + dislocate due to tumors too 
	1. hyperextension injuries, some fracture dislocation, epidural hemorrhage or abscess or something else in that space 
14. subluxation rheumatoid arthritis 
	1. dislocation of vertebra 
	2. this is a fracture dislocation 
	3. some ppl have dissections in vertebral artery with this 
15. cord trauma
	1. we can end up with a **post traumatic syrinx = syringomyelia - fluid filled cyst in spinal cord**
	2. or CNS tissue just squished in the spinal cord forev 
16. 2ndary effects of trauma
	1. swellling/edema
	2. loss f tissue - esp with contusions 
	3. hydrocephalus - dementia pugilistica
	4. brainstem hemorrhage secondary to herniation 
RFs:
- alc, previous head injury , seizure disorder, neuro dz
