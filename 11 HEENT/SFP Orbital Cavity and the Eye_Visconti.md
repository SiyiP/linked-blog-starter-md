#HEENT #anatomy 

orbit = the pyramidal cavity w/ base + apex, has roof, floor, medial + lat walls
the anterior margin of the orbit:
- frontal maxillary + zygomatic bones
the length + angle of lateral <<< medial walls must be noted
- if you need to access the eye, have the patients look medially + intro the injection into the lateral side. 

roof = frontal bone + lesser sphenoid wing 
lat wall = **zygomatic + greater sphenoid**
medial = frontal process of maxilla, lacrimal, orbital plate of ethmoid 
floor = zygomatic, maxilla + palatine 

foramina = optic canal - optic nerve + opthalamic artery 
superior orbital fissure - CN 3,4,5,6 and opthalmic vein 
infraorbital groove + foramen - and inferior orbital fissure

lacrimal groove - lac bone over the duct + sac 

there's a lot of orbital fascia + fat lining it 
- periorbita - the fascia - dense CT layer, **continuous with the periosteum lining the skull/endosteal layer of dura mater**

eyeball
- external fibrous layer - sclera + cornea allowing light passage 
	- sclera - white 
	- cornea - anterior, transparent, **avascular** part of the eye external layer, 
- middle later: heavily pigemnted and **vascularized**
	- choroid - most posterior - bt sclera + retina 
	- ciliary body - connects the choroid to the iris, there's **ciliary muscle there which will control lens hsape thru the zoneular fibers which make the suspensory ligament.**
		- **contraction** of ciliary body = will cause ciliary muscle to move anteriorly, **decreasing diameter and releasing tension on suspensory ligament!**
			- this makes it **rounder, inc refraction of light!**
	- iris - can dilate + constrict, pigmented- anterior to lens making **anterior + posterior chambers**
		- central aperture for light
		- circular fibers = **sphinctr pupillae parasympathetic causing constriction of pupil** = in the middle 
		- **radial fibers = dilator pupillae around, sympathetic fibers** causing dilation of pupil 
			- lets more light in like when you're running in forest in dark. 
- internal layer: retina - neuronal layer, inner nervous and otuer pigmented layer
	- anterior margin = **ora serrata**
	- optic disc - depressed area- insensitive to light, where optic nerve sorta connects
	- macula lutea - small oval area lateral to optic disc, center = fovea centralis, **area of most acute vision** = light detecting cells like **cones are most liekly to be there**

bulbar conjunctiva = thin moist transparent membrane covering it will reflect off the **posterior surface of eyelids = palpebral conjunctiva**
- makes recesses called superior + inf fornices on posterior + anterior eye 
- opens in palpebral fissure = space bt the open eyelids and eye 

refractive media is inside eyeballs:
- cornea 
- aqueous humor - in lens clear in **anterior + posterior chambers, nutrients to avascular lens + cornea**
- lens - avascular, held in place by suspensory lig
- vitreous body - jelly , 99% water, transmits ligth + holds retina + lens in place, transmission of light into retina 

eyelids - covered by skin + lined by **palpebral conjunctiva**
- strengthed by the **tarsal plate up top, , which has glands that secrete oily substance, tarsal glands**
- eyelashes have sebaceous glands 
- orbicularis oculi muscles - can help reinforce this strength 
lateral + medial canthis - where the dots of the eye are in the medial + anterior spot 
orbital septum will anchor these tarsal plates to the orbicularis oculi 

lacrimal apparatus
1. medial = lacrimal lake - lacus lacrimalis looks like our tear bed 
2. lacrimal caruncle - that bulge or circle in our tear bed center 
3. semilunar fold/plica semilunaris - fold of conjunctiva in this region 
4. lacrimal papillae - in the upper and lower eyelid immediately above + below the tear beds !!! 
5. lacrimal punctum - the holes in the middle of the lacrimal papillae! **for tear draining**
	1. they drain via lacrimal canaliculi into the lacrimal sac
	2. this sac will be drained by the nasolacrimal duct into the nasal cavity!!! via inferior nasal meatus 

tear production 
- lacrimal gland from the top lateral... has 2 parts
- orbital part - superolateral orgin generation of this 
- palpebral part - more close to the eyelid, tears will empty here raining to the midline 

voluntary eye muscles - 7 of these muscles 
1. levator palpebrae superioris
	1. inferior surface of sphenoid lesser insertion into skin of upper eyelid
	2. innervated by oculomotor **superior br** -> smooth muscle portion innervated by sympathetic fibers... which is **muller's muscle - inserting into superior tarsal plate - this muller's muscles reponsible for wide eyed startled look**
2. recti muscles-superior, inf, lateral media. 
	1. posterior origin common tendinous ring around optic canal + junction of superior + inf orbital fissures
	2. insertion into eyeball just posterior to the junction of sclera + cornea 
	3. superior, inferior, medial rectus all get supplied by oculomotor nerve
	4. but lateral rectus supplied by **abducent nerve** for motor
	5. medial rectus = adduction 
	6. lateral rectus - abduction 
	7. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	7. superior rectus - elevation, and since it's oriented not at midline it can **intorsion and adduction too!!**</mark>
	8. . inferior rectus - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">depression</mark>**, extorsion , adduction** 
3. oblique muslces - 2 of these
	1. superior oblique muscle comes from body of sphenoid bone , insertion into round tendon that runs thru the trochlea , the pulley, and moving in a 45 degree angle to insert onto posterior lateral eyeball 
		1.<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> trochlear nerve CN4!!!</mark>
		**intort** the eye, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">depression</mark>, **abduction**
	2. inf oblique from the maxilla , will pass laterally + posteriorly and insert into sclera at posteroinferior aspect of the lateral side 
		1. oculomotor nerve !!!
		2. **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">elevation</mark>, abduction, extorsion** 
recall: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">superior muscles intort .... SIN</mark>
alphabetical order: obliques are gonna **ab**duct the eye, and recti superior/inferior are gonna **add** up the eye 


axes of eye
- visual axis is not aligned wit the actions of the extraocular muscles of eye! 
- elevation , depression, abd, add, 
	- torsion - rolling movement towards the nose/midline 
	- extorsion - rolling away from midline 
	- intorsion - to the midline 

blood supply to eye
- ophthalmic artery - first br of **internal carotid a** emerging from **cavernous sinus**; branches: 
	- central a of retina - penetrate optic nerve into the eye 
	- ciliary a - to innervate ciliary body 
	- muscular a 
	- lacrimal a 
	- 5 others: supraorbital, supratrochlear, dorsal nasal, anterior, posterior ethmoidal aa = all these help perfuse the foramina 
veins
- both superior + inferior ophthalmic veins will drain these structures and **anteriorly anastamose to the facial veins**, drains into the cavernous sinus + the fossa/: 
- central vein of retina - but would die 

optic nerve - more like extension than nerve

frontal nerve - V1 ophthalmic division 
- divides into 2 br cutaneous for adult + face = supratrochlear + supraorbital nns

lacrimal n - carefully reflext lateral rectus , might be helpful 
- sensory to lacrimal gland + sensory info to **superior eyelid**

nasociliary n - br of V1 , br to the long ciliary nerve!!!
- sensory root to ciliary ganglion 
- long ciliary nn sensory innnervation 
- anterior + posterior ethmoidal nerves
- infratrochlear n 
![[extraocular muscles innervation chart.png]]

oculomotor n 
- superior division -> **levator palpebrae superioris + superior rectus m**
- C3 = inferior division -> to inf + medial rectus, inf oblique muscles, and **parasympathetic root of ciliary ganglion, and then innervates ciliary m + sphincter pupillae **

parasympathetic route
oculomotor nerve -> ciliary ganglion -> eye ->sensory fibers sent via the other part of the loop !! 
- there's a chance we can avoid the ciliary ganglion altogether and hop onto the eye via long and short ciliary nervs


usually just use ur finger.s 
test CN 4, look medially + downward -s uperior oblique
lateral rectus - look laterally CN 6 testing 
superior + inf oblique muscles - abduction of eye test ?? 

path
1. CN 3 palsy 
	1. affected eye is **down and out position, lack accomodatio and ptosis of the superior eyelid**
	2. after this CN 3 injury, superior oblique + lateral rectus = 
2. injury CN 4
	1. test superior oblique, bring eye down medially + down. 
	2. duplobia + extorsion of the eye from neutral! also a tiliting of head ! 
	3. upwards deviation when looking anywhere. 
3. CN6 palsy 
	1. test lateral rectus by asking them to bring out eye laterally using finger 
	2. medial deviation
