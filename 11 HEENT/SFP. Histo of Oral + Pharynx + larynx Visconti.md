lip H+E 
- SSKE = in the skin , epithelial apendages like hair and sweat 
- oral mucosa - salivary glands 
- orbicularis oris 
- thinner epithelium - vermillion border so lamina propia more visible 

tongue 
- posterior 1/3 is lingual tonsils like valleate papilla + palatotonsil between the palatoglossal and pharyngeal folds
- filiform papilla all over the anterior(SSKE), fungiform papilla, red + over tongue, follate papilla = **lateral posterior margin in anterior tongues**
- circumvallate = the back of tongue , anterior to that sulcus terminalis 
	- associated are von ebner serous glands which will secrete serous into the moats or spaces in between which keep taste buds current or clear the palate 
- taste buds are on the lateral sufaces o the papillae 
- skeletal msucle is multiple directions and orientations 
taste buds - 
- 3 cells
- **supporting clls, sensory cells both extending to apex  + basal cells not to the apical surface**
- taste pore up top on the apical side, and then microvilli too 

3 pairs of major salivary glands= secretes 1/3 L to 1 1/2 liters saliva... **90% of all saliva comes from here**
- paired parotids outside o face
	- all serous 
- submandibular also outside ... 
	- serous > mucous (demiluenes of serous secreting cells)
	- largest of intralobular ducts = simple columnar striated ducts -> leading to the interlobular ducts with increasingly stratified epithelium 
- sublingual deep to the mucosa, and instead of having a big duct like the others just carries it into it 
	- mucous > serous!! 
minor salivary glands = other 10% saliva thruout the day 


---
hard + soft palate separates 
- gingiva + raphe = no submucosa, these places are attached to bone
- in all other cases adipose seen under mucosa more anterior and more posterior we see mostly glands 
- in posterior part of palate - tensor + levator veli palatini m 
keratinized epithelium = loss of organelles + nuclei in the **superior layer** and we see keratohyalin granule contianing cells in the most superficial epithelium ... 

parakeratinized = not much keratin layer but we still see **cellularity in the mucosa up top.** 


vestibule = entrance to nasal cavity as you remember
- middle + inferior concha = **covered with respiraotry mucosa**
- **superior concha = covered by olfactory mucosa!!!** - specialized for smell 
anterior nasal cavity. =the hairs + brusae, capillaries to surface, SSK epithelium with vibrissae + sweat + sebaceous glands 

vestibulae, inferior + middle concha - resp epithelium PCCE
superior conchae - PCCE specialized olfactory epithelium 
- this is organized in basal cells
- supporting cells 
- olfactory cells - will have a dilation at the end of it, and at basla aspect, it will extend thru lamina propia, and into the **olfactory nerves forming them, then thru** the cribiform plate and into the olfactory bulb 
- has bowman's serous glands - provide medium for solubilization of odorants 
- olfactory nerves too 
- olfacotry epithelium is thicker and attached to the ethmoid bone! 

laryngopharynx 
- superor - from upper border of epiglottic cartilage to lower border of cricoid cartilage
- ant wall = inlet of larynx and posterior surface of larynx 
- posterior wall - pharyngeal constrctor muscles + bodies of C3-5 
- lateral walls = thyroid cartilage ... and piriform recess is on either side of posterior larynx 
- epiglottic - **has elastic cartilage**
	- lingual surface is SSE
	- laryngeal surface = resp epithelium seen posteriorly ... 
	- mixed lamina propia glands 
aryepiglottic folds make vestibule entry way 
vestibular folds aka false focal = laryngeal ventrical between this and the = true vocal folds
- ventricular folds have a lot of glands and theyre both covered with psudostratified epithelium columnar. 
- but in smokers they become stratified squamous nonkeratinized epithelium 
infraglottic space = underneath vocal fold. see stratified squamous -> **pseudostratified columnar epithelium ... a respiratory epithelium** 
- medial to that vocal fold = vocalis muscle 
- reason why theyr'e covered in stratified squamous epithelium instea d of pseudocolumnar: 
- **for mechanical forces!!! they need to be able to resist dmg to the forces instead of pseudostratified columnar epithelium**

opening bt and not including vocal folds = the rima 
vocal ligament - elastin + this is the portion which vibrations and repsponsible for phonation 

renke's space just below the vocal fold epithelium = has elastins = **clinically important bc it gets edematous associated with smoking and abuse of vocal folds**

pseudostratified columnar = respiratory epithelium
