always consider - consider we have to see and check vascular autoregulation 

Rare complication of carotid endarterectomy (removal of plaque) - carotid artery dz and artherosclerosis 
- this purpose is to restore blood flow to the brain, the surgical procedure which removes the plaque from carotid arteires
- plaque devleops in the tunica intima remember that
- most often right at the bifurcation of the carotids 

normal vessels - large elastic arteries 
- have tunica intima - 
	- endothelial simple squamous lining 
	- subendothelial CT, **which thickens in diseases and over time**
	- basement membrane 
- media
	- smooth muscle cells 
	- extracllular matrix - lots of elastin probably .... 
	- and a lot of muscles 
- adventitia 
	- largest vessels have a lot of vasa vasorum here to provide
	- loose CT

flow patterns - inflammation 
- flow patterns are measured as wave forms at the regioins of the carotids
- atheromas - don't develop in random locations 
if we expose endothelial cells to wave forms , we see **endothelial response to injury**
- if vessel dmg due to cytokines, hypoxia, exposure to lipids etc, **the makeup and phenotype of injured cell happens such as inducing adhesion, cytokines, gowth factors, etc. pro-inflammation**
- in the **plaque development**
	- insult: exposure to ldl + hemodynamic influences
	- repsonse: LDL gets into the intima and is oxidized
	- response - chronic inflammatory infiltrate with macrophages + t cells, M1 macrophages which are destructive, 
		- **infux of smooth muscle cells migrating in from the media**
		- once they migrate in, they proliferate and amplify + ingest the lipid -> cycle 
		- eventually SM cells secrete many other proteins, making a cap of necrotic degree
		- making more chronic inflam elements, like influx of chronic inflammatory cells, 
		- attempt to repair: **intima would try to grow cells**
mature atheroma grows - slowly occluding + obstructing vessels. complete with a carotid core + reduced lumen size 
gradually reduced blood flow + can rupture + cause hemorrhage + thrombogenesis at the site = this is **acute occlusion**
atheroma -> rupture = **complete closure of those vessels that were once in the atheroma!!**
- might also make antheroemboli!! -> downstrema occlusion 
- emboli from carotid plaque - unstable plaque breaks

growing obstruction = stable -> **critical stenosis... can still be fine with 85-90% blockage** bc that vasculature would compensate

circle f willis - has compensatory anastomoses
- internal carotid a -> anterior + middle portions of circle 
- vertebral artery -> basillar -> communication more 
- many ppl see - **gradual complete or partial blcking of 1+ internal carotid or vertebral arteries don't result in loss of blood flow**
	- - expansion and widening of vertebral arteries to compensate
- many ppl present with 80% blockage of both carotids without symptoms. 
- **but 19-48% ppl might have incomplete circle f willis, which fucks them over.**

how is it detected 
- stroke 
- TIA - transient ischemiic attack 
	- following this : non-invasion imaging - 
	- ultrasound imging - carotid duplex ultrasound CDUS 
asymptomatic patients - no hx of stroke/TIA
- **bruits - rush sound heard with stethoscope**
	- same , CDUS 
- light-headedness, numbness, weakness, speech/vision abnormalities 
	- if symptomatic following stroke: CT, MRI to assess degree of infarc 

CDUS 
- img the structure of blockage + spectral analysis - blood flow velocity + patterns 

when is carotid endarterectomy indicated
- CEA = gold standard of prevention both types... 
- highly recommended for pts with **symptomatic cartid stenosis**
	- or previous stroke/TIA
- some videos are in her lecture!!! 
- they don't usually do a stent unless their flow drops a lot 
- outcomes - excellent ... mortality rate is low 
	- cardiac events= typically due to flucctuating bp 
	- post op stroke like with plaque emboli, clotting, improper flushing 
	- **hyperperfusion syndrome**

pre-CEA - with the circle of willlis, if there's blocked carotid, there's also bigger vertebral artery as compensation 
- **autoregulation is another compensation - by arteriolar vasodilation - to maintain adequate cerebral flow!!!** thru the brain even when the bps vary - this is precapillary sphincter action 
- when u do the surgery on the more severe blocked part, the arterials should vasoconstrict against that new pressure!
- this autoregulation happens safely between 50 - 150 MAP and can adapt with stable maintenance of blood flow! **no matter what the pressure is.. but the ppl with chronic htn would shift more to the right**

a transient inc in cerebral blood flow is seen 3 days after the procedure **typically then goes down to baseline**
- but 20% of patients go beyond that level of inc... but most of them would go back down to okay level

hyperperfusion syndrome in the very litttle rate - in 3 days 
- ipsilateral headache, migraine like ; worst headache o their life!!!!
- **focal motor seizures**
- focal neurologic deficits
- **intracerebral edema + hemorrhage - death**
	- this will cause the deaths, very high rate death 

who ar the patients
- longstanding high grade 80%+ stenosis 
- perfrmed after recent 2 wk infarct 
- bilateral carotid occlusion 
- poorly regulated pre and post op systemic bp. - greater risk 
good evidence that these ppl have impaired cerebral autoregulation 
- normal autoreg = high CO2 and low O2 = with dilate, low bp. and low CO2 and high O2 = high bp, constriction. 
- but with exhausted cerebrvascular reactivity - no change in response to stimuli!

prediction of pre op decrease in cv reactivity 
- give them **acetazolamide** - sometimes a diuretic but carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
- - so you don't get CO2+H2O -> H2CO3- > H+ and HCO3-
- therefore buildup of CO2 = expect the vessels to autoregulate... then measure the flow rates to change 
cardiovascular reactivity in a percent form: = TRT CBF - resting CBF / Resting CBF * 100 
- this should be 38% inc 
- low is <28 inc 

free radical formation might cause impaired autoreg ... due to short term vessel clamping - which can cause NO , causing the dilation
- maybe not. major facotr, 
another reason - releasing clamp, then the vena c wil get a lot of o2 free bacteria onto the endoothelial 

also we don't mess with teh glossophayryngeal nerve thr. 
- can't respond to chem imbalances + pressure changes. 
htn -> inc pressure; transient hypersention 
bottom line - they might be already im
