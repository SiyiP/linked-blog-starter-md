The oculomotor nuclei (CNIII) are located just ventral to the periaqueductal gray.
Its visceral motor division is the Edinger Westphal nucleus (parasympathetic; pupil constriction., accommodation, eyelid elevation).
CNIII axons exit ventrally into the interpeduncular fossa.

Superior colliculus receives input from optic tract.
This tract helps coordinate head, neck, and eye movements. It crosses just dorsal to the median edge of red nucleus & its destination is neck and shoulder motor neurons of cervical cord. = the tectospinal tract are axons from the superior colliculus 

- The inferior colliculi sits in the caudal midbrain You can see the caudal midbrain (note the presence of the cerebral aquaduct and PAG) and rostral pons (as indicated by the horizontally running fiber bundles).
- The inferior colliculi are a relay for ascending auditory information.
- - The trochlear nucleus is located just ventral to the PAG within the caudal midbrain.![[Screenshot 2025-11-09 at 2.10.16 PM.png]]
- The facial nerve which originates from the facial nucleus innervates muscles for facial expression. The facial motor nucleus is found ventrolaterally to the abducens. Its fibers exit by looping over the abducens (forming the facial colliculus on the surface of the 4th ventricle) before traveling laterally (note the fibers just lateral to the nucleus).![[Screenshot 2025-11-09 at 2.11.41 PM.png]]![[Screenshot 2025-11-09 at 2.12.24 PM.png]]
- The trigeminal motor nucleus of CN V is found just medial to the principal sensory nucleus of CN V.
- CN V sensory enters & motor exits the brainstem laterally through the middle cerebellar peduncle.
 hypoglossal nerve exit the brainstem bt medullary pyramids and olives

recall - on the thoracic spine, any dmg to the  
- damage to the sympathetic outflow from the intermediolateral cell column: ipsilateral Horner’s Syndrome (ptosis, miosis, enophthalmos, flushing, hypohydrosis)
- on the front and lateral side, if u fuck that up you have decreased sympathetic thing bc that's where the sympathetic outflow is - the intermediolateral cell column 

What would be the symptoms of damage in the area marked with hatch marks? - see both sides of anterior and lateral hatched

Loss of pain & temperature sensation bilaterally below the level of the lesion due to damage to both anterolateral tracts. 

Flaccid paralysis of bilateral muscles controlled by the segments with inadequate flow, due to loss of  horn motor neurons.

Paralysis of bilateral hand, trunk & legs  the level of the lesion due to loss of both cortico-spinal tracts.

- Loss of pain & temperature sensation bilaterally below the level of lesion due to damage to both anterolateral tracts. 
    - Feedback:  (tactile and proprioception is intact - spring of dorsal columns.)
- Flaccid paralysis of bilateral muscles controlled by the segments with inadequate flow, due to loss ventral horn motor neurons.
- Paralysis of bilateral hand, trunk & legs below the level of lesion due to loss of both cortico-spinal tracts.
    - Feedback: With spasticity, increased reflexes of extensors and Babinski sign). Indicative of upper motoneuron lesion
