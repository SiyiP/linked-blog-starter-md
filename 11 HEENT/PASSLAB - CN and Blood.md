The oculomotor nuclei (CNIII) are located just ventral to the periaqueductal gray.
Its visceral motor division is the Edinger Westphal nucleus (parasympathetic; pupil constriction., accommodation, eyelid elevation).
CNIII axons exit ventrally into the interpeduncular fossa.

Superior colliculus receives input from optic tract.
This tract helps coordinate head, neck, and eye movements. It crosses just dorsal to the median edge of red nucleus & its destination is neck and shoulder motor neurons of cervical cord. = the tectospinal tract are axons from the superior colliculus 

- The inferior colliculi sits in the caudal midbrain You can see the caudal midbrain (note the presence of the cerebral aquaduct and PAG) and rostral pons (as indicated by the horizontally running fiber bundles).
- The inferior colliculi are a relay for ascending auditory information.
- - The trochlear nucleus is located just ventral to the PAG within the caudal midbrain.![[Screenshot 2025-11-09 at 2.10.16 PM.png]]
- The facial nerve which originates from the facial nucleus innervates muscles for facial expression. The facial motor nucleus is found ventrolaterally to the abducens. Its fibers exit by looping over the abducens (forming the facial colliculus on the surface of the 4th ventricle) before traveling laterally (note the fibers just lateral to the nucleus).![[Screenshot 2025-11-09 at 2.11.41 PM.png]]![[Screenshot 2025-11-09 at 2.12.24 PM.png]]
- The trigeminal motor nucleus of CN V is found just medial to the principal sensory nucleus of CN V.
- CN V sensory enters & motor exits the brainstem laterally through the middle cerebellar peduncle.
 hypoglossal nerve exit the brainstem bt medullary pyramids and olives
