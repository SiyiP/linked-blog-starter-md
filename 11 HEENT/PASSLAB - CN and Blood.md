The oculomotor nuclei (CNIII) are located just ventral to the periaqueductal gray.
Its visceral motor division is the Edinger Westphal nucleus (parasympathetic; pupil constriction., accommodation, eyelid elevation).
CNIII axons exit ventrally into the interpeduncular fossa.

Superior colliculus receives input from optic tract.
This tract helps coordinate head, neck, and eye movements. It crosses just dorsal to the median edge of red nucleus & its destination is neck and shoulder motor neurons of cervical cord. = the tectospinal tract are axons from the superior colliculus 

- The inferior colliculi sits in the caudal midbrain 
- You can see the caudal midbrain (note the presence of the cerebral aquaduct and PAG) and rostral pons (as indicated by the horizontally running fiber bundles).
- The inferior colliculi are a relay for ascending auditory information.
- - The trochlear nucleus is located just ventral to the PAG within the caudal midbrain.![[Screenshot 2025-11-09 at 2.10.16 PM.png]]
- The facial nerve which originates from the facial nucleus innervates muscles for facial expression. The facial motor nucleus is found ventrolaterally to the abducens. Its fibers exit by looping over the abducens (forming the facial colliculus on the surface of the 4th ventricle) before traveling laterally (note the fibers just lateral to the nucleus).![[Screenshot 2025-11-09 at 2.11.41 PM.png]]![[Screenshot 2025-11-09 at 2.12.24 PM.png]]
- The trigeminal motor nucleus of CN V is found just medial to the principal sensory nucleus of CN V.
- CN V sensory enters & motor exits the brainstem laterally through the middle cerebellar peduncle.
 hypoglossal nerve exit the brainstem bt medullary pyramids and olives

recall - on the thoracic spine, any dmg to the  
- damage to the sympathetic outflow from the intermediolateral cell column: ipsilateral Horner’s Syndrome (ptosis, miosis, enophthalmos, flushing, hypohydrosis)
- on the front and lateral side, if u fuck that up you have decreased sympathetic thing bc that's where the sympathetic outflow is - the intermediolateral cell column 

What would be the symptoms of damage in the area marked with hatch marks? - see both sides of anterior and lateral hatched

Loss of pain & temperature sensation bilaterally below the level of the lesion due to damage to both anterolateral tracts. 

Flaccid paralysis of bilateral muscles controlled by the segments with inadequate flow, due to loss of  horn motor neurons.

Paralysis of bilateral hand, trunk & legs  the level of the lesion due to loss of both cortico-spinal tracts.

- Loss of pain & temperature sensation bilaterally below the level of lesion due to damage to both anterolateral tracts. 
    - Feedback:  (tactile and proprioception is intact - spring of dorsal columns.)
- Flaccid paralysis of bilateral muscles controlled by the segments with inadequate flow, due to loss ventral horn motor neurons.
- Paralysis of bilateral hand, trunk & legs below the level of lesion due to loss of both cortico-spinal tracts.
    - Feedback: With spasticity, increased reflexes of extensors and Babinski sign). Indicative of upper motoneuron lesion

lesioned lateral and dorsal on cord = the external cuneate nucleus
Some ipsilateral arm ataxia due to loss of relay of proprioceptors to cerebellum through external cuneate nucleus


middle medulla = on the inside of that it has 
- hypoglossal n
- medial lemniscus 
- medullary pyramid 
- hypoglossal nucleus 

hypoglossal n: Tongue deviates toward the side of the lesion and will exhibit loss of muscle bulk ipsilaterally  
  

medial lemniscus: Contralateral loss of tactile and proprioception from neck down  
  

medullary pyramid: Contralateral paralysis from the neck down

![[nucleus in medulla.png]]
medial lemniscus
Contralateral loss of tactile and proprioception from neck down due to loss of medial lemniscus.

pyramid
Contralateral paralysis from the neck down due to loss of the pyramidal tract.

rostal medulla: 
vestibular nuclei : Ipsilateral difficulty with balance  
CN V tract: Loss of pain/temp sensation from ipsilateral face  
inf cerebellar peduncle: Ipsilateral ataxia and cerebellar signs  
anterolateral system: Loss of pain and temperature sensation from entire contralateral half of body
- penetrating br of PICA -> infusing those things 
- infusing the parts in the inf cerebellar peduncles 

![[caudal pons nuclei.png]]

Occlusion of penetrating branches from the anterior       inferior cerebellar artery (AICA).

medial longitudinal fasciculus - Defects in coordination of movements between both eyes (internuclear ophthalmoplegia)
medial lemniscus - loss of tactile and proprioception from entire contralateral body

Medial lemniscus: Contralateral loss of tactile and proprioception from face and arm  
- Medial lemniscus: Contralateral loss of touch, pressure, vibration
Middle cerebral peduncle fibers: Contralateral paralysis of face and arm
Cerebral peduncle: Contralateral paralysis from neck down
medial geniculate nucleus - hearing 

rostral midbrain occlusion - Occlusion of penetrating branches from the posterior cerebellar artery.

lesion in optic tracts and lateral geniculate nucleus - : Blindness in contralateral visual field of both eyes
- these are supplied by the middle cerebral artery 

Which of the following is a result of damage to the genu and rostral posterior limb of the internal capsule?
- contralateral paralysis of whole body 
- rostral thalamus : Occlusion of lenticulostriate and anterior choroidal branches from the middle cerebral artery

anterior cerebral a = To anterior limb of internal capsule (contains cortico-striatal connections)
posterior cerebral a. = To caudal posterior limb of internal capsule (contains ascending somatosensory fibers)

_Meyer's loop_ constitutes the most anterior extension of the optic radiation in the temporal horn
	Blindness in upper contralateral visual field of both eyes
	this is on the lateral and lower part of the head 
- **wernicke's area is near the back and the broca's area is near the front**
	Fluent aphasia

on the right side of the brain, in that similar lateral area - 
nondominant parietal cortex: Decreased spatial/ constructional skills and contralateral neglect


----
medial medulla - anterior spinal artery perfusion = middle medulla 
- **pyramids**, **medial lemniscus (position+vib sense**, hypoglossal nucleus) = all in the medulla 
- **contra arm + leg weakness,** contra dec position + vib sense , ipsilateral tongue weakness since it catches the exiting CN XII fascicles 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	- huge is hypoglossal symptoms! </mark> = ASA medial 

lateral medulla - vertebral artery - **wallenberg's syndrome**; this is PICA too! 
			recall - pica from the vertebral artery... they both are going more lateral 
- inf cerebellar peduncle + vestibular nuclei = ipsi ataxia, vertigo, nystagmus, nausea
- trigem nuc + tract -> ipsi facial dec pain and temp 
- spinothalamic tract - contralat body dec pain and temp 
- descending sympathetic fibers = ipsi horners 
- nuc ambiguus = hoarse + dysphagia 
- nuc solitarius = ipsi dec taste 
	- **huge is nucleus ambiguus involvement!** 

rostral medulla - PICA occlusions too 
- Loss of pain  and temperature sensation from entire contralateral half of body due to damage to ALS.
- Ipsilateral ataxia and cerebellar signs due to damage to inferior cerebellar peduncle.
- Loss of pain/temp sensation from ipsilateral face due to loss of tract of CN V.
- Ipsilateral difficulty with balance due to damage to vestibular nuclei.


caudal medulla - think PSA - posterior spinal artery 
- Ipsilateral loss of touch, pressure, vibration & proprioception sensation from neck down due to loss of gracile and cuneate nuclei.
- Some ipsilateral arm ataxia due to loss of relay of proprioceptors to cerebellum through external cuneate nucleus


in the pons 
caudal pons - 
medial ? 
- interruption of basilar artery - paramedian branches
- pons nuclei, medial longitudinal fasciculus, abducens, pyramidal tract 
- all corticospinal/corticobulbar tracts 
- facial collicullus - ipsi face weakness + gaze palsey, more and more 

lateral caudal pons - AICA
- middle cerebellar peduncle - ataxia ipsi
- v<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">estibular nuc = vertigo , nystagmus </mark>
- trigem nuc + tract - ipsi facial dec pain+temp
- **facial nerve ipsi facial paralysis, dec taste, dec lacrimation/salivation**
- spinothalamic tract = contra body dec pain+temp 
- descending sympathetic fibers = horner's ipsilateral syndrome
- maybe smoe ipsilat hearing loss 
	- just know - this has no dysphagia like symptoms unlike the PICA's or vertebral artery one 

rostral pons - dorsolateral = SCA
- superior ceerebellar peduncle + cerebellum = ataxia 

in the midbrain: 
1. webers = PCA brs and top of basilar a 
	1. oculomotor n fascicles - ipsi 3rd nerve palsy 
	2. cerebral peduncle - contralat paralysis 
2. claude syndrome = midbrain tegmentum = brs of pca + top of basilar 
	1. same deal with oculomotor but 
	2. red nucleus + superior cerebellar peduncle = contra ataxia 
3. benedikts - brs of pca + top of basilar a 
	1. oculomotor, cerebral peduncle AND the red nucleus involvement 
- lesion to the PCA = we would see **hemi** vision loss on both sides AND loss of mechanosensation completely on ctontralateral side 




basilar long circum brs
- Ipsilateral paralysis of jaw muscles and loss of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">jaw reflexes due to damage to motor and sensory nucleus of CN V and its nerve</mark>
- dmg to contralat sensation of all sensation from contralateral side of body = **dmg to medial lemniscus**
- lack of eye coordination = medial **longitudinal fasciculus**
	- basilar artery = gonna supply the aicas , which gives more **caudal pons**
	- ont eh middle of the pons we rlly have that long circum. brs of basilar artery which spans both medial and lateral parts of the pons 
	- can still do **abducens eye movements bc they're in the more ROSTRAL part of the midbrain!**

L hemisphere lat side = L MCA!!!! ascending 
- UMN paralysis waist up on the right = precentral gyrus 
- loss sensation from waist up on the R side = postcentral gyrus dmg 
- difficulty with speech - broca's + wernickes' 

descending MCA lesion 
- contra auditory deficits + contra superior quadrantanopia -(meyere's loop dmg)
	- in the meyeres looop recall - upper bank of calcarine fissure is contralateral lower visual quadrant
	- lower bank calcarine fissure = contralat upper visual quadrant 

anything with jjust: UMN paralysis **waist down** and the loss sensation waist down on L side = 
- R hemisphere medial side lesion 
- this is caused by the **right ACA!**
- recall that the ACA provides to medial front and the MCA to the lateral 


----
contralateral loss of sensation from the whole body + blindness in contralateral visual field of both eyes 
visual processing - in the cerebrum. 
- posterior cerebral artery -> think visual field loss - bitemporal **homonymous** hemanpiopia 
	- can be at level of lat geniculate nucleus, optic radiations, and optic tracts 
- contralateral loss sensation of the whole body - the DCML *AND* ALS, have both crossed since the midbrain, and then to the **THALAMUS**
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the PCA provides blood to the thalamus</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the posterior limb of the internal capsule = is provided by MCA on the other hand. this will be the same dmg</mark>
		- but the MCA - we have more MOTOR effects, SPEECH, HEARING
		- **we have a lot more symptoms with the MCA occlusion**
