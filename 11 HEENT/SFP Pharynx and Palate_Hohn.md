pharynx - funnel shaped area, opening anteriorly to nasal cavities, mouoth, and larynx, the choanae of the nostrils 
- extends to C6 - beginning of esophagus 
- a conduit for air entering lungs + food to stomach 
parts and function 
in the posterior view of pharynx - from skull to the soft palate. 
- nasopharynx - posterior to nasal cavities, opening is the choanae 
	- most superior portion , superior to the soft palate ; the other part o the roof is the hypophyseal fossa 
	- roof = body of sphnenoid + basilar occipital bone (pharyngeal tonsil, deep to the soft palate roof)
	- floor = soft palate
	- anterior wall = choanae 
	- posterior = superior pharyngeal **constrictor muscle**s 
	- lateral walls = pharyngeal opening of auditory tube - pharyngotymapanic tube - eustacion tube as well 
		- along this lateral wall: 
		- under the auditory tube there's cartilage
		-  2 muscles deep to the soft palate = **tensor + levator veli palatini muscles**
		- levator veli palatini. = will elevate soft palate sealing up the nasal pharynx - **prevents food from regurgitating into nasal cavity**
		- tensor veli palatini - on that back wall - 
		- torus tubarius - tubal elevation = in the posterior aspect off that auditory tube  
		- from that inferior aspect of torus tubarius, salpingopharyngeal fold is there , where it's mucosa covering the salpingopharyngius muscle
		- salpinopharyngius muscle - from the cartilage of auditory wall **down to the lateral wall of the nasopharynx**
		- uvulus muscle - muscularus uvulae deepest layer 
		- posterior to torus tubarius- pharyngeal recess 
	- know that this nasopharynx continuous with the oropharynx at the **pharyngeal isthmus**, marked by mucosal fold caused by the **palatopharyngeal sphincter, which is a part of that superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle** on the inferior aspect 
- oropharynx - posterior to oral cavity , extending down tot he epiglottus 
	- roof is soft palate + pharyngeal isthmus 
	- floor = posterior 1/3 of **tongue and valleculae, a mucosal depression, pharyngeal tongue**
		- on that superior surface of the tongue 
		- the **terminal sulcus separates that 2/3 anterior from 1/3 posterior**
		- valleculae - pair of mucosal pouches - **etween base of tongue + epiglottis**
		- glossoepiglottic folds binding this place laterally and one medially tooo, dividing that space into 2 
		- palatine tonsils will be seen between palatoglossal + palatopharyngeal folds 
			- palatopharyngeal folds are more far back than the palatoglossal folds. 
			- these are ovoid collection of lymphoid tissues covered by mucosa - crypts of medial surface which is projecting into the oral cavity 
			- these will reach their early size **early on and atrophy after puberty** = hard to find in the cadavers. 
			- path: tonsilitis - bacterial infection, sore throat, high fever, bad breath + palatine tonsil inflammation... bc of **accumulation of bacteria in the crypts** - making **tonsil stone calcifications, sulfurous**
				- deep cervical lymph nodes draining tonsils are enlarged and tender.
				- tonsillectomy - indicated for repeated infections
				- complication = **hemorrhages... bc tonsillar artery br of facial artery is in that **tonsillar sinus**
				- largest supplier of blood is tonsillar a from the facial artery, but also these tonsillar branches from all these other areas too. 
				- also external palatine veins' pretty large and in there. 
	- anterior wall - oropharyngeal isthmus 
		- bound laterally by these palatoglossal arches. 
		- and then the posterior and medial to the palatoglossal folds = palatopharyngeal arch 
		- the oropharyngeal isthmus can be closed to hold onto liquid + food in mouth while breathing 
			- palatoglossal arches - **contract down** and medial 
			- palatopharyngeal arches - **contract down** and medial 
			- posterior tongue move up 
			- soft palate - down and forward. 
	- posterior - pharyngeal constrictor muscle 
	- Lateral walls - 
		- palatoglossal folds - arches, the palatoglossis muscle  covered with layer of mucosa forming the boundary of the oropharyngeal isthmus 
			- binds the lateral wall 
		- the **palatopharyngeal folds cover the palatopharyngeaus. , posterior + medial to those palatoglossal folds**
			- this is a landmark for palatine tonsils 
		- palatine tonsils - **within that tonsillar sinus, highly vascularized area between the folds**
		- pterygomandibular raphe - the band of attachment for the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle + the **buccinator**
- laryngopharynx - posterior to laryngeal inlet - this should be start at the superior tip of the epiglottus down to C6 the esophagus 
	- from superior bordr of epiglottic cartilage 
	- to the inf border of cricoid cartilage 
	- down that **anterior wall = laryngeal inlet + posterior aspect of larynx**
	- posterior wall = pharyngeal constrictor muscles AND bodies of 3-5th cervical vertebrae 
		- bounded by laterally the thyroid cartilage. 
		- piriform recesses - mucosal recesses, covered by it -
			- lateral to the laryngeal inlet 
			- these are deep depressions!
			- directs solids/iquids from oral cavity **around** **raised** laryngeal inlet and into esophagus , preventing that larynx food entry... 
			- **common site for lodging of foreign bodies , fish bones** - fish bones common here. lodged in this area, complaining "feel liek smth's in my throat, repeated gagging"
			- deep to the piriform recess mucosal - entrance of internal laryngeal nerve as it pierces thyroid membrane - 
				- **internal br of superior laryngeal nerve = CN X**
				- deep to the piriform recess
				- **passes thru thyrohyoid membrane to reach larynx** -> supplies sensory innervation to laryngeal mucosa above vocal folds 
- the trachea happens at the bottom of esophagus 
muscle layers of pharynx - 
- 3 circular 
	- superior pharyngeal constrictor 
		- from pterygoid hamulus, pterygomandibular raphe, mylohyoid line of mandible 
		- to the pharyngeal raphe !!! median point posteriorly **joins all the pharyngela constrictors**
		- constric wlal of pharynx during swallowing+ seals off that yu're not regurgitating food into that nasal cavity 
		- vagus N = via pharyngeal plexus 
	- middle pharyngeal constrictor 
		- origin from stylohyoid lig , horning at hyoid -> pharyngeal raphe
		- to constrict wall pharynx during swallowing, innervated by vagus 
	- inferior pharyngeal constrictor 
		- from olique line of thyroid cartilage/cricoid-cartilage -> pharyngeal raphe (this is on the postrerior side, this extends all the way from base of skull -> C6) 
		- to constrict wall pharynx during swallowing, innervated by vagus duh 
	- extranote - cricopharyngeus muscl, not in lab id, but this is the most inferior fibers of the inf pharyngeal constrictor muscle 
		- **sphincter at lowest end of pharynx to prevent entry of air into esophagus when swallowing food**
		- CN X 
		- this is a valve at lowest pharynx ! protects esophagus 
- 3 longitudinal muscles 
	- salpingopharyngeus - covered by mucosal ->salpingopharyngeal fold
		- from the auditory tube -> lateral pharyngeal wall 
		- **elevates pharynx, + larynx during swallowing + speaking** propelling that food down to esophagus
		- it also open the pharyngeal opening of the auditory tube to equalize pressure bt middl ear + pharynx in swallowing 
		- Vagus X 
	- palatopharyngeus - > makes palatopharyngeal fold when surrounded with mucosa 
		- palatine aponeurosis -> lateral pharyngeal wall 
		- tenses soft palate, elevating pharynx + closes oropharyngeal isthmus 
		- helps close the isthmus to maintain food in oral cavity while breathing 
		- CN 10 
	- stylopharyngeus
		- from styloid process of temporal, best from the posterior view-> pharyngeal wall, posterioor of thyroid caritlage 
		- elevate pharynx + larynx during swallowing + speaking to propell food down 
		- **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">only muscle CN 9!! glossopharyngeal nerve</mark>** underneath it
blood supply of pharyngeal wall 
- all vessels of uppser pharyngeal wall = **external carotid a origins**
	- ascending pharyngeal a 
	- br of facial a like **ascending palatine, tonsillar a**
	- br of maxillary + lingual aa 
- lower pharynx - pharyngeal brs of inf thyroid a , **which is from that thyrocervical trunk, which is part of the subclavian a**

innervation of pharynx 
- all motor via CN x except stylopharyngeus, which is CN 9 
- sensory innervation  
	- nasopharynx - just know V2, maxillary n 
	- oropharynx - CN 9  via pharyngeal plexus 
	- laryngopharynx - vagus nerve , specifically **internal laryngeal nerve, a branch of the superior laryngeal nerve!!!** the br that entrs into the hyoid membrane 

CN 9 
- motor to the stylopharyngeus m
- sensory info to the lowest portion of naspharynx, most of which innervated by V2 instead. 
- and the entire oropharynx down to laryngopharynx 

CN X 
- almost all muscles of pharynx in motor  
- sensory to the laryngopharynx via internal layrngeal nerve, br off the superior laryngeal nerve 

palate - 
hard palate = composd of palatine process of maxilla nanteriorly + horizontal palatine bone posteriorly 

soft palate = mobile fold attached to posterior aspect of hard palate 
- free posterior border - off that central area is the uvula 
- laterally it's continuous with the pharyngeal walls 
- mucosa, fibrous palatine aponeurosis + 5 muscles 
	- palatopharyngeus m - 
	- palatoglossus  - without htat mucosal covering, 
		- from palatine aponeurosis to lateral margin of tongue, to **elevate tongue posteriorly, and depress the palate**
		- innervate via CN x 
	- levator veli palatini
		- petrous part f temporal bone + auditory bone -> palatine aponeurosis
		- this is to elevate soft palate while swallowing 
		- looks like it's originate/comign right out of the auditory tube 
		- innervated by X 
	- tensor veli palatini 
		- frm medial pterygoid palte, spine of sphenoid, auditory tube -> palatine aponeurosis 
		- tense the soft palate, o**pens auditory tube, equalizing the pressure bt auditory tube + pharynx** during swallowing + yawning, helping out the levator 
		- **gets innervated by mandibular nerve br, V3!!!**
	- musculus uvulae - from posterior border of hard palate + palatine aponeurosis -> mucosa of uvula
		- elevates + retract uvula  works to seal off the nasopharynx 
		- vagus CN X 

innervation of palate!
- recall - the pteropalatine ganglion having that greater petrosal nerve going into it into the pteropalatine fossa 
- also branches coming from the ganglion inferiorly - > 
	- greater palatine nerve V2 -> general sensory into the gums via the palatine canal then the greater palatine foramen , to the hard palate 
	- nasopalatine nerve V2 -> going thru the incisive canal into the nasal septum to give that mucosa of hard palate information 
	- lesser palatine nerve, V2 also going thru the palatine canal and lesser palatine foramen = also the general sensory but for the soft palate 
		- recall - soft palate does have taste buds, conferred back to the **greater petrosal nerve** via the lesser palatine nerve travelling back up tot hat pterygopalatine ganglion 
	- special sensory -> taste is from the soft palate, to have that greater petrosal nerve 

path: 
CN X palsy 
- going liek "aaa" to see soft palate raise bilaterally 
- - unilateraly injury to CN X will cause dysphagia due to paralysis on injured side 
- also seen is **contralateral** deviation of **uvula during elevation = CN X dysfunction = levator veli palatini + muscularus uvulae** are **unopposed**.
