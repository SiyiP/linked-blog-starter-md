sinusoidal wave 
- we interpret our frequency / hz/pitch 
- and intensity = loudness, distance bt peak and trough , dB 
	- decibels log scale relative to our minimum detection threshold 
	- 10^-12 W/m^2 and highest sound intensity 1 W/m^2 
	- ref intensity = 120 dB - our hearing range. ; dB intensity = 10* log(Imeasured/Ireference)
	- pressure can also be used to measure sound level - lowest pressure is 20 uPa... 
	- and dB = 20 * log(Pmeasured/Pref)
	- **note inc in 3 dB is 2x as loud, +10 is 10x louder, and +20 is 100x higher!!!**
- sensitivity also depends on frequency !!!
- note - sound level of safe sound 
- and frequency range is 20Hz-20 kHz
- intensity range is 10^12 or 120 dB 
- most sensitive range = 2-4 kHz = for verbal and vocal communication 
- pain range = more high, but much more flat detection. 

ear structure 
external ear - capture vibrations
- pinna = earlobe funnels into ear canal for 100x amplification for 2-5 khz sounds = the structural explaination for why we got that sensitivity for that range! 
- external auditory meatus - focus + amplifies sound on eardrum, reaching and vibing tympanic membrane the junction between these section! 
- while sound waves move in air, fewer energy loss 

middle ear - ossicles + tympanic membrane transmit to sensory organ 
- loss of sound wave energy in fluid, but this energy loss is **compensated by by having that middle ear gain 20-25 dB for ALL freq to compensate via acoustic impedance matching**
	- tympanic membrane entrance, 20x larger than the oval window which is way smaller and it leaving, basically concentration of that sound from a 20x larger drum into a -> tiny oval window/stapes. 
	- lever action = ossicles will amplify the force by pushing it !! incus and stapes and lalleus 
	- stapes = assciation with oval window, putting that sound info into that cochlear fluid 
	- 2 muscles - help make sure we don't get too much sound 
		- tensor tympani  - malleus, CN V 
		- stapedius - stapes, SN VII = protect inner ear by stiffening the ossicular chain to dcrease sound 
			- paralysis => hyperacusis , which means **sensitivity to sound if these muscles are paralysed**
	- eustachian tube = this compares the air to **nasopharynx , basically meaning multiple ear infections from upper respiratory infection** happens all the time 

inner = sensory organs transduce to neural signals 
- cochlea - collects sound waves puts int he tympanic membrane , middle ear transfers , coiled and encased in bone
- we will have it **unrolled in the diagrams!**
- ![[Screenshot 2025-10-20 at 11.51.38 AM.png]] inside the cochlea 
- - in thru the oval which the stapes interacts with , out thru the round window. 
- helicotrema = the apex and swing back around 
- fluid inside: 
	- scala tympani = perilymph - 
		- this is high Na+ , low K+ , similar to **extracellular** fluid 
	- middle compartment = **endolymph, media, which is where the scala media, where signal transduction happens**
		- **middle compartment separated by reissner's membrane**
		- this is low Na+ high K+ similar to **intracellular fluid
		- stria vascularis makes this composition of endolymph
		- driving force for K+ scala media to scala tympani = 80+ mV !!!!= **endochochlear potential makes the ability to change into neural signals, depolarization of hair cells -> afferents in spiral ganglion to transmit!**

- encoding freq information 
	- the **cochlea is topographically organized!!! each spot on it is selective for a specific frequency!!!**
	- high responds at base to low repsonds at the apex!!!!
	- basal end = narrower. + stiffer than the apical end!!! this is the structural explaination for this 
		- basilar membrane - where the signal transduction actually happens. 
and any complex sounds of many encoding thing 
- sum of responses to the pure tone components of that sound 

coiled cochlea - why are they coiled? basilar membrane is there... 
- intact cochlea
- stria vascularis - this will make **endolymph within the reissnr's membrane compartment**
	- dmg to this = *can't transduce sound, sensitivie to loop diuretics + aminoglycoside antibiotics longterm.*
	- driving force = diff in K+ necessary for transduction 
- spiral ganglion - afferents innervating hair cells, carrying the information from cochlea into the CNS + mod the activity of cochlea via the CNS 
- organ of corti. - **site of transduction sitting on the basillar membrane**
	- inner hair cells = like in a single row = **actual sound transduction** - these are linked to afferent axons to directly transmit 
		- highly aferent fiber innervated... but some 
		- some of it is effferent which is not synapsing on this but **synapsing on the afferent fiber to mod what's going to the CNS**
		- inner hair cells to auditory nerve!!! this nerve codes for stimulis frequency + intensity 
			- recall = frequency is already recorded based topographically 
			- as **amplitude inc, firing rate of afferent inc, encoding the sound intensity**
			- each individual fiber can have their very own firing property .... helping us cover that dynamic and wide range for amplitude - **diff firing thresholds** 
			- basically louder= encoding a wide range of intensities, more of the nerves => summation of APs/signals 
	- outer hair cells - have more of these - to **amplify and mod the sound**= innervated by **efferent axons**
		- cochlear amplifier- amplifying response to the displacement of basilar membrane, basically over a **narrow range** ; electromotility 
		- and making sure you pull the tectorial membrane closer to the stereocilia, making it more sensitive, pushing / pulling the membrane closer
		- activated by the basilar membrane AND **superior olivary input** + inner hair cell input  
		- highly innervated by efferent from superior olive , innervated by some of the **afferent directly**
		- they're just receiving more than what they send. 
	- resting on top of these = is the **tectorial membrane on top gelatinous and then the hair cells have a physical attachment to it!**
	- steroeocilia + kinocilium , basically displacement of these -> K+ gates opened!! **depolarization = signal to the afferents.**
	- the hair is physically tethered to each other, tip links are there to **anchor to the neighbor's ion channel**
- pathway: 
sound induced vibration -> displace basilar membrane , wiggling at the topographically appropriate location -> stereocilia pushed against tectorial membrane "shearing force" making these sterocilia move -> stereocilia bend 
mechanotransduction when the stereocilia bend
-> K+ channels open -> K+ enters FROM the endolymph into the perilymph outside, and the-> cell depolarizes , voltage gated ca channels excited-> release of transmitter glutamate to **afferent nerves**
- glutamate release from inner hair cells = graded 
- basically changing the number of open cation channels = changes infrmation to the afferents
we release different amounts of glutamate depending on the signal.
