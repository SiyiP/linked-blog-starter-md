sinusoidal wave 
- we interpret our frequency / hz/pitch 
- and intensity = loudness, distance bt peak and trough , dB 
	- decibels log scale relative to our minimum detection threshold 
	- 10^-12 W/m^2 and highest sound intensity 1 W/m^2 
	- ref intensity = 120 dB - our hearing range. ; dB intensity = 10* log(Imeasured/Ireference)
	- pressure can also be used to measure sound level - lowest pressure is 20 uPa... 
	- and dB = 20 * log(Pmeasured/Pref)
	- **note inc in 3 dB is 2x as loud, +10 is 10x louder, and +20 is 100x higher!!!**
- sensitivity also depends on frequency !!!
- note - sound level of safe sound 
- and frequency range is 20Hz-20 kHz
- intensity range is 10^12 or 120 dB 
- most sensitive range = 2-4 kHz = for verbal and vocal communication 
- pain range = more high, but much more flat detection. 

ear structure 
external ear - capture vibrations
- pinna = earlobe funnels into ear canal for 100x amplification for 2-5 khz sounds = the structural explaination for why we got that sensitivity for that range! 
- external auditory meatus - focus + amplifies sound on eardrum, reaching and vibing tympanic membrane the junction between these section! 
- while sound waves move in air, fewer energy loss 

middle ear - ossicles + tympanic membrane transmit to sensory organ 
- loss of sound wave energy in fluid, but this energy loss is **compensated by by having that middle ear gain 20-25 dB for ALL freq to compensate via acoustic impedance matching**
	- tympanic membrane entrance, 20x larger than the oval window which is way smaller and it leaving, basically concentration of that sound from a 20x larger drum into a -> tiny oval window/stapes. 
	- lever action = ossicles will amplify the force by pushing it !! incus and stapes and lalleus 
	- stapes = assciation with oval window, putting that sound info into that cochlear fluid 
	- 2 muscles - help make sure we don't get too much sound 
		- tensor tympani  - malleus, CN V 
		- stapedius - stapes, SN VII = protect inner ear by stiffening the ossicular chain to dcrease sound 
			- paralysis => hyperacusis , which means **sensitivity to sound if these muscles are paralysed**
	- eustachian tube = this compares the air to **nasopharynx , basically meaning multiple ear infections from upper respiratory infection** happens all the time 

inner = sensory organs transduce to neural signals 
- cochlea - collects sound waves puts int he tympanic membrane , middle ear transfers , coiled and encased in bone
- we will have it **unrolled in the diagrams!**
- ![[unfurled cochlea.png]] inside the cochlea 
- - in thru the oval which the stapes interacts with , out thru the round window. 
- helicotrema = the apex and swing back around 
- fluid inside: 
	- scala tympani = perilymph - 
		- this is high Na+ , low K+ , similar to **extracellular** fluid 
	- middle compartment = **endolymph, media, which is where the scala media, where signal transduction happens**
		- **middle compartment separated by reissner's membrane**
		- this is low Na+ high K+ similar to **intracellular fluid
		- stria vascularis makes this composition of endolymph
		- driving force for K+ scala media to scala tympani = 80+ mV !!!!= **endochochlear potential makes the ability to change into neural signals, depolarization of hair cells -> afferents in spiral ganglion to transmit!**
![[cross section of cochlea.png]]

- encoding freq information 
	- the **cochlea is topographically organized!!! each spot on it is selective for a specific frequency!!!**
	- high responds at base to low repsonds at the apex!!!!
	- basal end = narrower. + stiffer than the apical end!!! this is the structural explaination for this 
		- basilar membrane - where the signal transduction actually happens. 
and any complex sounds of many encoding thing 
- sum of responses to the pure tone components of that sound 

coiled cochlea - why are they coiled? basilar membrane is there... 
- intact cochlea
- stria vascularis - this will make **endolymph within the reissnr's membrane compartment**
	- dmg to this = *can't transduce sound, sensitivie to loop diuretics + aminoglycoside antibiotics longterm.*
	- driving force = diff in K+ necessary for transduction 
- spiral ganglion - afferents innervating hair cells, carrying the information from cochlea into the CNS + mod the activity of cochlea via the CNS 
- organ of corti. - **site of transduction sitting on the basillar membrane**
	- inner hair cells = like in a single row = **actual sound transduction** - these are linked to afferent axons to directly transmit 
		- highly aferent fiber innervated... but some 
		- some of it is effferent which is not synapsing on this but **synapsing on the afferent fiber to mod what's going to the CNS**
		- inner hair cells to auditory nerve!!! this nerve codes for stimulis frequency + intensity 
			- recall = frequency is already recorded based topographically 
			- as **amplitude inc, firing rate of afferent inc, encoding the sound intensity**
			- each individual fiber can have their very own firing property .... helping us cover that dynamic and wide range for amplitude - **diff firing thresholds** 
			- basically louder= encoding a wide range of intensities, more of the nerves => summation of APs/signals 
	- outer hair cells - have more of these - to **amplify and mod the sound**= innervated by **efferent axons**
		- cochlear amplifier- amplifying response to the displacement of basilar membrane, basically over a **narrow range** ; electromotility 
		- and making sure you pull the tectorial membrane closer to the stereocilia, making it more sensitive, pushing / pulling the membrane closer
		- activated by the basilar membrane AND **superior olivary input** + inner hair cell input  
		- highly innervated by efferent from superior olive , innervated by some of the **afferent directly**
		- they're just receiving more than what they send. 
	- resting on top of these = is the **tectorial membrane on top gelatinous and then the hair cells have a physical attachment to it!**
	- steroeocilia + kinocilium , basically displacement of these -> K+ gates opened!! **depolarization = signal to the afferents.**
	- the hair is physically tethered to each other, tip links are there to **anchor to the neighbor's ion channel**
- pathway: 
sound induced vibration -> displace basilar membrane , wiggling at the topographically appropriate location -> stereocilia pushed against tectorial membrane "shearing force" making these sterocilia move -> stereocilia bend 
mechanotransduction when the stereocilia bend
-> K+ channels open -> K+ enters FROM the endolymph into the perilymph outside, and the-> cell depolarizes , voltage gated ca channels excited-> release of transmitter glutamate to **afferent nerves**
- glutamate release from inner hair cells = graded 
- basically changing the number of open cation channels = changes infrmation to the afferents
we release different amounts of glutamate depending on the signal.

central processing of sound! 
primary auditory pathway 
![[auditory afferent pathway.png]]
- thisis just information from one side
- we start integrating information for both ears EARLY!!!
- tonotopic organizationis maintained throughout , frequency is kept - > all these afferents corresponding will synapse and move together. 
sound localization 
- elevation information = cochlear nucleus very first inormation 
- azimuth = superior olive requires biaural input , and from then on we're binaural!!!!

from the cochlea to brain 
- inner hair cell - spiral ganglion -> 
- cochleovestibular nerve - from those spiral ganglion -> cochlear nucleus ,

cochlear nuc = on brainstem 
- CN8 cochlear afferents synapse on ipsilateral cochlear nuclei - lateral medulla 
- these fibers will bifurcate to anteroventral cochlear nucleus and to posteroventral + dorsal cochlear nuc = divisions have diff cell types + connectivity = parallel processing 
CN8 - cochlear afferents synapse exclusively in **ipsilateral cochlear nuclei**
- they will bifurcate to anteroventral cochlear nuc + to the posteroventral + dorsal cochlear nuclei- 
- - parallel processing diff cell types + connectivity 
- primary projection from the cochlear nuc => ipsilateral and contralateral **superior olivary complex, nucleus of lateral lemniscus, inf colliculus + contralateral cochlear nucleus**
	- we have a lot of interconnected information merging 

superior olivary complex - first **binaural center + combined ipsilateral and contralateral areas**
- will have multiple aspects and subdivisions that process diff aspects of signals 
- for our purposes, know above and that it's the **largest soruce of efferents traveling back to the inner and outer hair cells!!**
- fibers from this project to interior colliculus via the lateral lemniscus 

inf colliculus - map of auditory space 
- source of reflex connections orienting us to sound, make eyes reflexively orient to loud/sudden sounds - orient eyes to sudden loud sounds  
- - gets inputs from multiple levels of central pathway 
- primary pathway out of superior olive -> lateral lemniscus pathway -> **termination in the inferior colliculus always if you take the lateral lemnicscus**
- inferior colliculus gets **fully processed information downwards from the auditory cortex.**
	- has maximal hz columns and maps due to high freq base, low freq apex. etc. 
ipsilaterally from the inferior colliculus (already binaural) -> **medial geniculate nucleus of thalamus** 
	first one to get this in the pathway. 
- deaf if we don't get this connection to work 
- this is obligate site for any auditory info to the cortex 
- primarily innervated by inferior colliculus fibers + also the descending input from auditory cortex. 
	- labeled line = again topographically carried together 
- this will project to auditory cortex via the **sublenticular portion of internal capsule!**

auditory cortex - 
- on the dorsal surface of temporal lobe - **prox to sylvian fissure**
- in the **posterior superior temporal gyrus = Brodmann's 41 + 42.** very ismilar and clse to BA 22 wenicke's 
- many multipel secondary auditory areas around that primary area 
- auditory cortical columns - show distinct tuning properties, freq + ear speciicity = **cortical columns, related sensitivities in a column , helps us tell differences**

auditory brainstem response
- electrodes measure transmission of cochlea into **brainstem, not alll the way up to the cortex**
- looking at one ear click and then measure neuronal depolarization. 
- ![[auditory brainstem response.png]]
- 1 + 2 = auditory nerve activity 
- wave 3-5 = brainstem + midbrain waves 
threshold = lowest intensity with **reliable wave 5** = that's your individual sound we can check. 

patho
1. hearing loss happens, aged hearing loss presbycusis 
	1. tends to be accumulated dmg in cochlea just due to hearing, 
	2. loud sound exposure -> hair cell dmg + ear drum rupture inner ear trauma, cumulative effects too 
	3. we can get infection s- otitis media with middle ear + inner ear 
	4. otosclerosis = of ossicles + cochlea = ossification of these structures
	5. ototoxic drugs - poisoning of stria vascularis via **loop diuretics**
	6. poisoning of hair cells via **aminoglycoside antibiotics**
 2. conductive hearing loss = due to impairmnent in this conduction of sound thru external ear canal + ossicles = **happens in external and middle ear** 
3. sensorineural = any impairment **from basilar membrane up!** 
- hair cells look bad when u see noise traumas - dmg

weber tuning fork test 
- based on bone conduction 
- conduction loss = sound louder in affected ear 
	- lost middle air - so air sound is not being amplified! **there is no acoustic impedance matching so it's quieter when u get to that ear**
	- you can carry it thru bone .... 
	- bone better than ear - hear it better on ear due to bone 
	- heard loudrer in worse ear... so **sound would rather be transmitted thru the bone.... bone conducted sound seems louder bc not masked by external noise**

- sensorineural loss = sound louder in unaffected ear 
	- bc the middle ear is functioning, conductive working is still there. better than transmission in bone. \
	- sound better in the unafffected ear - **bc it can process the sound from the tuning fork better than the other ear which can't even take it up**
	- intact middle ear = think that you have ear sound louder than bone bc **it gets amplified!!!**
	- if we get dmg'd middle ear - **bone louder than ear.**

rinne test - put it on bone and then ear air 
- normal sound louder by air conduction bc of the amplificatin of the middle ear 
- sensorineural = loss = sound louder via air conduction
- conductive loss = sound is louder via the bone 

hearing aids
- air conduction , amplifier, **good for conductive deafness due to decrease not a complete loss**
- bone conductive, = similar. - stuck on surface of scalp, conducting thru bone - **good for complete conduction loss bc shakes and transmits directly to cochlea**
- middle ear implants, - **surgery putting amplifier into middle ear - mic externally picks up and then amplifier would vibrate the ossicles** = good for conductive types and **sensorineural when it's about the cochlear dmg**
- cochlear implants - electrode under basilar membrane -**sensorineural , electronically stimulate the afferents directly to have computations**
