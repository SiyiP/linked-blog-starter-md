sinusoidal wave 
- we interpret our frequency / hz/pitch 
- and intensity = loudness, distance bt peak and trough , dB 
	- decibels log scale relative to our minimum detection threshold 
	- 10^-12 W/m^2 and highest sound intensity 1 W/m^2 
	- ref intensity = 120 dB - our hearing range. ; dB intensity = 10* log(Imeasured/Ireference)
	- pressure can also be used to measure sound level - lowest pressure is 20 uPa... 
	- and dB = 20 * log(Pmeasured/Pref)
	- **note inc in 3 dB is 2x as loud, +10 is 10x louder, and +20 is 100x higher!!!**
- sensitivity also depends on frequency !!!
- note - sound level of safe sound 
- and frequency range is 20Hz-20 kHz
- i<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ntensity range is 10^12 or 120 dB </mark>
- most sensitive range =<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> 2-4 kHz = for verbal and vocal communication </mark>
- pain range = more high, but much more flat detection. 

ear structure 
external ear - capture vibrations
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pinna</mark> =<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> earlobe funnels into ear canal</mark> for 100x amplification for 2-5 khz sounds = the structural explaination for why we got that sensitivity for that range! 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">external auditory meatus - focus + amplifies sound on eardrum,</mark> reaching and vibing tympanic membrane the junction between these section! 
- while sound waves move in air, fewer energy loss 

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">middle ear - ossicles + tympanic membrane</mark> transmit to sensory organ 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">loss of sound wave energy in fluid,</mark> but this energy loss is **compensated by by having that middle ear <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">gain 20-25 dB for ALL freq</mark> to compensate via <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">acoustic impedance matching</mark>**
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tympanic membrane entrance, 20x larger than the oval window </mark>which is way<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> smaller and it leaving</mark>, basically concentration of that sound from a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">20x larger drum into a -> tiny oval window/stapes. </mark>
	- lever action = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ossicles will amplify the force by pushing it</mark> !! incus and stapes and lalleus 
	- s<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tapes = association with oval window, putting that sound info into that cochlear fluid</mark> 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	- 2 muscles - help make sure we don't get too much sound </mark>
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tensor tympani </mark> - malleus, CN V 
		- stapedius - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">stapes</mark>, SN VII =<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> protect inner ear</mark> by **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">stiffening</mark> the ossicular chain to dcrease sound** 
			- paralysis => hyperacusis , which means **sensitivity to sound if these muscles are paralysed** [[SFP Disorders of the Ear I+II_Dixon]]
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">eustachian tube</mark> = this <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">compares the air to **nasopharynx</mark> , **basically meaning multiple ear infections from upper respiratory infection** happens all the time 

inner = sensory organs <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">transduce</mark> to neural signals 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cochlea - collects sound waves puts in the tympanic membrane , middle ear transfers , coiled and encased in bone</mark>
- we will have it **unrolled in the diagrams!**
- ![[unfurled cochlea.png]] inside the cochlea 
- in oval out round!!!!!
- - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">in thru the oval which the stapes interacts with , out thru the round window. </mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">helicotrema</mark> = the<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> apex and swing back around </mark>
- fluid inside: 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">scala tympani = perilymph - </mark>
		- this is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">high Na+ , low K+ </mark>, similar to **extracellular** fluid 
	- middle compartment = **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">endolymph</mark>, media, which is where the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">scala media</mark>, where signal transduction happens**
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">		- **middle compartment separated by reissner's membrane**</mark>
		- this is<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> low Na+ high K+ </mark>similar to **intracellular fluid
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">stria</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">vascularis</mark> makes this composition of endolymph
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">driving force for K+ scala media to scala tympani = 80+ mV</mark> !!!!= **endochochlear potential makes the ability to change into neural signals, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">depolarization</mark> of hair cells -> afferents in spiral ganglion to transmit!**
![[cross section of cochlea.png]]

- encoding freq information 
	- the **cochlea is topographically organized!!! each spot on it is selective for a specific frequency!!!**
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">high freq responds at base to low freq repsonds at the apex!!!!</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">basal end = narrower. + stiffer than the apical end!!</mark>! this is the structural explaination for this 
		- basilar membrane - where the signal transduction actually happens. 
and any complex sounds of many encoding thing 
- sum of responses to the pure tone components of that sound 

coiled cochlea - why are they coiled? basilar membrane is there... 
- intact cochlea
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">stria vascularis </mark>- this will <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">make</mark> **endolymph within the reissnr's membrane compartment**
	- dmg to this = *can't transduce sound, sensitivie to<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> loop diuretics </mark>+ <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">aminoglycoside</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">antibiotics</mark> longterm.*
	- driving force = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">diff in K+ necessary for transduction </mark>
- spiral ganglion - a<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fferents innervating hair cells</mark>, carrying the information<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> from cochlea into the CNS</mark> + mod the activity of cochlea via the CNS 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">organ of cort</mark>i. - **site of transduction sitting on the<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> basillar membrane</mark>**
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inner</mark> hair cells = like in a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">single row </mark>= **actual sound transduction** - these are linked to afferent axons to directly transmit 
		- highly aferent fiber innervated... but some 
		- some of it is efferent which is not synapsing on this but **synapsing on the afferent fiber to mod what's going to the CNS**
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inner hair cells to auditory nerve</mark>!!! this nerve codes for stimulis frequency + intensity 
			- recall = frequency is already recorded based topographically 
			- as **amplitude inc, firing rate of afferent inc, encoding the sound intensity**
			- each individual fiber can have their very <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">own firing property .</mark>... helping us cover that dynamic and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">wide range for amplitude -</mark> **diff firing thresholds** 
			- basically louder= encoding a wide range of intensities, more of the nerves => summation of APs/signals 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">outer</mark> hair cells - have more of these - to **amplify and mod the sound**= innervated by **efferent axons**
		- cochlear <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">amplifier</mark>- amplifying response to the<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> displacement of basilar membrane, </mark>basically over a **narrow range** ; <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">electromotility</mark> 
		- and making sure you<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> pull the tectorial membrane closer to the stereocilia, making it more sensitive, pushing / pulling the membrane closer</mark>
		- activated by the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">basilar membrane AND **superior olivary input** + inner hair cell input  </mark>
		- highly<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> innervated by efferent from superior olive </mark>, innervated by some of the **afferent directly**
		- they're just receiving more than what they send. 
	- resting on top of these = is the **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tectorial</mark> membrane on top gelatinous and then the hair cells have a physical attachment to it!**
	- steroeocilia + kinocilium , basically d<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">isplacement of these -> K+ gates opened!! </mark>**depolarization = signal to the afferents.**
	- the hair is physically tethered to each other, tip links are there to **anchor to the neighbor's ion channel**
- pathway: 
sound induced vibration -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">displace basilar membrane</mark> , wiggling at the topographically appropriate location -> s<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tereocilia pushed against tectorial membrane</mark> "shearing force" making these sterocilia move -> stereocilia bend 
mechanotransduction when the stereocilia bend
-> K+ channels open -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">K+ enters FROM the endolymph into the perilymph outside</mark>, and the-> cell depolarizes , voltage gated ca channels excited-> release of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">transmitter glutamate</mark> to **afferent nerves**
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">glutamate</mark> release from<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> inner hair cells = graded </mark>
- basically changing the number of open cation channels = changes infrmation to the afferents
we release different amounts of glutamate depending on the signal.

central processing of sound! 
primary auditory pathway 
==![[auditory afferent pathway.png]]==
- thisis just information from one side
- we start <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">integrating information for both ears EARLY!!!</mark>
- tonotopic organizationis maintained throughout , frequency is kept - > all these afferents corresponding will synapse and move together. 
sound localization 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">- elevation information = cochlear nucleus very first inormation </mark>
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">- azimuth = superior olive requires biaural input , and from then on we're binaural!!!!</mark>

from the cochlea to brain 
- inner hair cell - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">spiral ganglion -> </mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cochleovestibular</mark> nerve - from those spiral ganglion -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cochlear nucleus </mark>,

cochlear nuc = on brainstem 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CN8 cochlear afferents synapse on ipsilateral cochlear nuclei - lateral medulla </mark>
- these fibers will<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> bifurcate to anteroventral cochlear nucleus </mark>and to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">posteroventral + dorsal cochlear nuc </mark>= divisions have diff cell types + connectivity = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">parallel processin</mark>g 
CN8 - cochlear afferents synapse exclusively in **ipsilateral cochlear nuclei**
- they will bifurcate to anteroventral cochlear nuc + to the posteroventral + dorsal cochlear nuclei- 
- - parallel processing diff cell types + connectivity 
- primary projection from the cochlear nuc <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">=> ipsilateral and contralateral</mark> **superior olivary complex, nucleus of lateral lemniscus, inf colliculus + contralateral cochlear nucleus**
	- we have a lot of interconnected information merging 

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">superior olivary complex -</mark> first **binaural center + combined ipsilateral and contralateral areas**
- will have multiple aspects and subdivisions that process diff aspects of signals 
- for our purposes, know above and that it's the **largest soruce of efferents traveling back to the inner and outer hair cells!!**
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">- fibers from this project to interior colliculus via the lateral lemniscus </mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inf colliculus</mark> - map of auditory space 
- source of<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> reflex connections orienting us to sound</mark>, make <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">eyes reflexively orient</mark> to loud/sudden sounds - orient eyes to sudden loud sounds  
- - gets inputs from multiple levels of central pathway 
- primary pathway <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">out of superior olive -> lateral lemniscus pathway</mark> -> **termination in the i<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">nferior colliculus </mark>always if you take the lateral lemnicscus**
- inferior colliculus gets **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fully processed information </mark>downwards <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">from the auditory </mark>cortex.**
	- has maximal hz columns and maps due to high freq base, low freq apex. etc. 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ipsilaterally</mark><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> from the inferior colliculus (already binaural) </mark>-> **medial geniculate nucleus of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">thalamus</mark>** ; 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">mgn!!!</mark> needs to get to the cortex 
	first one to get this in the pathway. 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">- deaf if we don't get this connection to work </mark>
- this is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">obligate site for any auditory info to the cortex </mark>
- primarily innervated by inferior colliculus fibers + also the descending input from auditory cortex. 
	- labeled line = again topographically carried together 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">- this will project to auditory cortex via the **sublenticular portion of internal capsule!**</mark>

auditory cortex - 
- on the<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> dorsal surface of temporal lobe</mark> - **prox to sylvian fissure**
- in the **posterior superior temporal gyrus = Brodmann's 41 + 42.** very ismilar and clse to BA 22 wenicke's 
- many secondary auditory areas around that primary area 
- auditory cortical columns - show distinct tuning properties, freq + ear speciicity = **cortical columns, related sensitivities in a column , helps us tell differences**

auditory brainstem response
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">electrodes</mark> measure transmission of cochlea into **brainstem, not alll the way up to the cortex**
- looking at one ear click and then measure neuronal depolarization. 
- ![[auditory brainstem response.png]]
-<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> 1 + 2 = auditory nerve activity </mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">wave 3-5 = brainstem + midbrain waves </mark>
threshold = lowest intensity with **reliable wave 5** = that's your individual sound we can check. 

patho
1. hearing loss happens, aged hearing loss <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">presbycusis</mark> 
	1. tends to be <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">accumulated dmg in cochlea just due to hearing, </mark>
	2. loud sound exposure -> hair cell dmg + ear drum rupture inner ear trauma, cumulative effects too 
	3. we can get infection s- otitis media with middle ear + inner ear 
	4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">otosclerosis</mark> = of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ossicles + cochlea =</mark> ossification of these structures
	5. ototoxic drugs - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">poisoning of stria vascularis via **loop diuretics**</mark>
	6. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">poisoning of hair cells via **aminoglycoside antibiotics**</mark>
 2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">conductive</mark> hearing loss = due to impairmnent in this conduction of sound thru external ear canal + ossicles = **happens in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">external</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">middle</mark> ear** 
3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sensorineural</mark> = any impairment **from basilar membrane up!** 
- hair cells look bad when u see noise traumas - dmg

weber tuning fork test 
- based on bone conduction 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">- conduction loss = sound louder in affected ear </mark>
	- lost middle air - so air sound is not being amplified! **there is no acoustic impedance matching so it's quieter when u get to that ear**
	- you can carry it thru bone .... 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	- bone better than ear - hear it better on ear due to bone </mark>
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	- heard loudrer in worse ear... so **sound would rather be transmitted thru the bone.... bone conducted sound seems louder bc not masked by external noise**</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">- sensorineural loss = sound louder in unaffected ear </mark>
	- bc the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">middle ear is functioning, conductive working is still there</mark>. better than transmission in bone. \
	- sound better in the unaffected ear - **bc it can process the sound from the tuning fork better than the other ear which can't even take it up**
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">intact middle ear = think that you have ear sound louder than bone</mark> bc **it gets amplified!!!**
	- if we get dmg'd middle ear - **bone louder than ear.**
	- since we can't amplify the sound via the middle ear we think the bone feels louder than the air canal one? 

rinne test - put it on bone and then ear air 
- normal sound louder by air conduction bc of the amplificatin of the middle ear 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sensorineural = loss = sound louder via air conduction
</mark>- 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">conductive loss = sound is louder via the bone </mark>

hearing aids
- air conduction , amplifier, **good for conductive deafness due to decrease not a complete loss**
- bone conductive, = similar. - stuck on surface of scalp, conducting thru bone - **good for complete conduction loss bc shakes and transmits directly to cochlea**
- middle ear implants, - **surgery putting amplifier into middle ear - mic externally picks up and then amplifier would vibrate the ossicles** = good for conductive types and **sensorineural when it's about the cochlear dmg**
- cochlear implants - electrode under basilar membrane -**sensorineural , electronically stimulate the afferents directly to have computations**
