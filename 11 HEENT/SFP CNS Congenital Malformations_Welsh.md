neural tube defects
neural tube starts as a plate then gotta roll up and close 
1. anencephaly - cranially - open and MOST common CNS malformation - 
	1. at 28 days gestation + not compatible with life - you end up with 
	2. cerebrovasculosa - CNS tissue would aggregate abnoramlly , CSF fluid is very caustic - 
2. encephalocele - brain outside the cranium but will be covered by skin 
	1. uncommon and rare - but this is cool and super variable 
	2. frequently inflammation related = these are **adult-acquired**
		1. mastoiditis
		2. chronic sinusitis = where the inflammation would eat thru the bone!!! 
	3. in a baby tho - we see a lot of brain out there - occipital outpuching is the most common 
3. spinal dysraphism - spinal cord doesn't close 
	1. myelomenigocele (cord, the meninges protrudes togehter more often + worse scenario)> meningocele
	2. lumbosacral-bladder bowel + walking issues is the location 
	3. associated = chiari malformation!!!
		1. i fyou correct that surgically, you need to help out with CNS obstruction and then shunt them later. 
4. DX the neural tube defect
	1. AFP open , made by CNS, and open neural tube -> gets out into the mom's blood stream 
	2. ultrasounds 
	3. prevent with folate prenatals 
	4. diabetes control 
	5. changing antiseizure meds 
	6. multiple genes involved through 

posterior fossa anomalies - recall the cerebellar structure. vermis in the way we shouldn't see the 4th ventricle - all have **hydrocephalus in common w that ventricle**
1. chiari malformations
	1. type 1= tonsil of cerebellum hangs down and obstructs spinal canal 
		1. adult comig in with headaches + problems 
		2. need to take out the fossa 
	2. type 2 - vermis hangs down and obstructs, making a beak. = this is what we see in the lumbosacral **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">myelomenigocele</mark>** iin spinal dysraphism
	3. type 3 - encephalocele 
2. dandy-walker malformation 
	1. part of the vermiis is missing - vermiis hypoplasia or aplasia... 
	2. bc of that there's a **big cyst causing hydrocephalus**
	3. clinical correlates
		1. deveopmental delays in motor _ lang, seizures, vision + hearing impairment - probaly something else but associated_
cerebral aqueduct problems - not many explainations but in kids there's a virus. 
- stenosis - not large enough lumen 
- forking - with tiny bits and pieces making worthless openings where fluid doesn't flow through 

forebrain anomalies 
1. arrhinecephaly - no olfactory - anosmia - but no other problems  = like latula?? 
2. holoprosencephaly - developmental delay, intellectual disability + 
	1. note = **with miidline facial problems there's a developmental iissue. cyclopia proboscis for instance.** facial mainy mirrors the brain or cerebral issues 
	2. lobar - pretty good hemisphere division, lobe formation, midline fusion. = see some midline fusion and some lobes... 
	3. semilobar - pseudo division of hemisphere but no lobes
	4. alobar - no hemi no lobe 
	5. characterized by a monoventricle + fusion of basal ganglia on MRI! 
3. associated - 14 genes, **recall<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> trisomy 13 and 18</mark>!!! and teratogens**

migration defects- **all in common seizures**
recall - the cells that end up in the cortex start in the ventricles. 
- cells that will go thru the raidial glial -> cortex. = this is physiological 
- layer 6 would mgrate up first etc. 
- normal fetal brain - has dark gray matter + germinal matrix.... which have nuclei in caudate + germinal matrix
- caudate + germinal matrix = those cells will migrate out... - 
- normal dev - also **increasing gyral formation with age. at 22 wks smooth brain!** 
1. agyria - lissencephaly - birth with no gyri ; not survivable 
2. pachygyria - really fat gyri, some look normal but some are just too thick. - basially mgration defect. 
3. polymicrogyria - too many small gyri? 
	1. just no sulci - very bumpy 
	2. looks too busy, but if u slice thru the brain it's the same 
	3. there's no sulci really, makes an attempt but not really making it 
	4. usually 4 or less layers where the normal are usually 6 layers in the cortex. 
4. gray matter heterotopias - where the periventricular gray matter which would **mature in place instead of migrating or regressing - this tends to be too many nuclei or ventricles, all in the occipital or some lesions**
	1. many seizures

destructive lesions - almost all is the MCA territory or larger - seems **to be a vascular issue, many times bilateral**
1. focal - migration abnromalities, maybe destruction all the way down the center??
	1. seizures common 
	2. some ventricles but very much space 
	3. porencephaly - seen loss of that gray matter
2. widespread = hydranecephaly - MCA and midline destruction 
	1. the edge o the lesion - normal to abruptly stops. cells that never make it to the cortex
3. cavum septum - very common 
	1. 2 separate leaflets in septum in between the lateral hemispheres, but 
	2. these don't really fuse !!! - so we see a little cave or hole between the 2 lateral holes 
	3. no effects really. 
	4. can happen later - acquired at adulthood 
4. corpus callosum agenesis
	1. can be isolated or assiociated
	2. total  the "bat sign" on imaging 
	3. partial - maybe caused by lipoma not making it develop normally!!! you're not supposed to have fat in skull but if it's there its midline we don't know why 
5. spinal cord malfoormation 
	1. spaces in spinal cord -
	2. hydromelia - central canal is way too big 
	3. springomyelia - with tissue hole , can see as developmental issue or with some kinda  tumor 
	4. diastomyelia - centrally there's a separator that makes 2 divisions of a canal - suually in lumbosacral region 

perinatal brain injury - most often in premies 

1. subarachnoid hemorrhage is very common and frequent after birth !
2. bleeding in ventricles can come thru posterior fossa 
3. 1. germinal matrix hemorhage
	1. tiny blood vessels in the germinal matrix - don't take the bp change from baby to adult formation well 
	2. next to the ventricls - will expand and blow out the ventricles
	3. normal germinal matrix - thin wall and big BVs which let things flow out 
4. hypooxic/ischemic dmg
	1. affects cortex - worse at the bottom of the base of the brain , base of the sulcus, 
	2. makes ulegyria - which look like mushroom , thin little springs 
	3. widespread grey matter dmg with 2ndary white matter loss 
	4. in babis specifically: 
		1. they get periventricular white matter dmg 
		2. in premies oligodendrocytes sensitive to hypoxic dmg (not true in adults)
		3. so white matter tracts are killed
		4. surviving kid would myelinated things incorrectly afteraards: status marmoratus, marbled state in thalamus 
5. kernicterus - problem in premies bc liver immature
	1. bilirubin depos in different places medulla+dentate
	2. bilirubin in adults don't happen bc of BBB
	3. in babies no BBB yet 
occult lesion
