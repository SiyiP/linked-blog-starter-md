dev of repro system? 
weeks 7-8 = diff of mesonephric + paramesonephric ducts begin 
- both are there at first 
- in males: MIF <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">mullerian inhibitory factor from sertoli cells</mark> -> degen of paramesonephric ducts -> **appendix testis**
	- "leydig cells Lead to male diff, Sertoli cells Suppress female diff?"
	- SEED = mesoneprhic duct = seminal vesicles, epididymis, ejac duct, ductus defs
- then Leydig cells make T -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">differentiation of mesoneprhic duct into male internal genitalia except prostate</mark>
- in female : default phenotype and absence of MIF means paramesophric ducts turn into female internal genitalia like fallopian tubes, uterus, prox vagina ... and the mesonephric ducts dege into <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">gartner ducts with absence of T</mark>
wk 12 = ext genitalia 
wk 20 - phenotypic diff complete 
wk 33 = descent of gonads 
embryology 
genital tubercle -> primordial phallus -> 
- glans penis, corpus cavernosum, corpus spongiosum 
- or glans clit, vestibular bulbs 
cloaca -> urogenital sinus -> precursor of bladder + urethra in both sexes
- bulbourethral / cowper glands, prostate gland
- in women: bartholin or greater vestibular glands, skene/urethral+paraurethral glands, distal vagina, vestibule 
urogenital folds
- ventral penile shaft + penile urethra
- labia minora
labioscrotal swelling
- scrotum 
- labia majora 

gonads must migrade caudally from their initial retroperitoneal location thru inguinal ring into scrotum 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">gubernaculum induces intraabdominal migration = gubernaculum is a band of tissue that then becomes the scrotal ligament in men and the ovarian + round ligament of uterus in women</mark>
- inc in Intra abd pressure forces them thru inguinal canal 
- gubernaculum regresses 
processus vaginalis - evagination of peritoneum accompanying the testis into scrotum before closing -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">turns into the tunica vaginalis but is obliterated in the female.</mark>
- in males - failure to close or patent processus vaginalis = hydrocele or <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">indirect inguinal hernia</mark>
- if dysfunctional it's testicular torsion as well 



![[biosyn of adrenal steroid hormones.png]]
congenital adrenal hyperplasia - autosomal recessive gene mutation of enzymes responsible for cortisol, aldosterone and sometimes androgens. 
all forms have: 
	low cortisol(ZF of adrenal cortex) -> lack of negative pituitary feedback -> 
	 increased ACTH (anterior pituitary gland, stimulating glucocorticoids + androgen secretion in adrenal cortex) 
		 - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">note about this - Melanocyte stimulating hormone is cleaved from ACTH's precursor so HYPERPIGMENTATION in areas!</mark>
	 -> adrenal **hyperplasia**  + inc synthesis of adrenal precursor steroids 
	 - chance of getting adrenal crisis due to low glucocorticoids !! fever , abd pain, n/v , impaired consciousness, shock 
- 21-hydroxylase = most common 
	- h**ypo**tension = saltwasting of hypoaldosteronism + hypocortisolism 
	- precocious puberty in boys + female pseudohermaphroditism !!! and or male genitalia along with female testes 
	- virilization. 
	- 11-Deoxycorticosterone DOC goes <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">down, as a compound formed from progesterone by this enzyme!!!</mark>
		- has some mineralcorticoid activity , as a mineralcorticoid precursor <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">which leads to the suppression of RAAS usually resulting from low aldosterone lvls</mark>
		- we basically losing a lot of water and salts = hypotension 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fludrocortisone therapy as aldosterone substitution</mark>
- 17a-hydroxylase
	- htn, in *spite* of hypoaldosteronism due to DOC activity 
	- delayed puberty in girls , normal fem genitalia at birth 
	- in boys, female genitalia with blind ending pouch + testes inside. 
	- 11-deoxycorticosterone goes UP 
	- spironolactone = to block mineralocorticoid receptors 
- 11b-hydroxylase 
	- hypertension 
	- similar deal to the precocious puberty in boys + female pseudohermaphroditism !!! and or male genitalia along with female testes , virilization!
	- precocious puberty in boys 
	- spironolactone = to block mineralocorticoid receptors 
- this would inc or dec the androgen production 
think = one doc.... if deficient enzyme starts with 1 there's increased doctor 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">AND one = if it ends with 1 , androgens are INC!!!</mark>



aromatase def = CYP19A1 gene mutation AR, 
- defective/absent **aromatase** 
	- -> lower conversion of testosterone to estrogen -> serum e falls with rising testosterone 
- dec estrogen + inc androgens 
- in girls, ambiguous ext genitalia with normal internal, virilization, amenorrhea 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">maternal virilization during pregnancy due to fetal androgens crossing placenta....</mark>
- post birth = testosterone up, androstenedione(intermediate in biosynthesis of estrone + testosterone released by the adrenal gland) up, e down. 
- impaired maturation of secondary sex characteristics in females 
- hyperglycemia + weight gain + fatty liver (insulin impaired tissue response to it)
- tall due to excessive bone growth with slowed mineralization, osteoporosis 

ovotesticular disorder - SRY gene translocation from Y to X chromosome 
- in XY ppl - hypospadias, cryptochidism, testicular enlargement, gyno
- mixed testicular + ovarian dysgenesis 
- ovotestis = ambiguous genitalia 
- 
- 

kallmann syndrome - multiple gene mutations that are responsible for migrating GnRH releasing neurons from olfactory 
- hypogonadotropic hypogonadism  = pituitary gonadotropins FSH and LH low and subsequently low E and T.... 
- defective GnRH releasing neurons from olfactory bulbs from bad migration to the hypothalamic preoptic nuclei = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">GnRH secretion down, underdev of olfactory bulbs</mark> => therefore low pituitary secreton of FSH/LH therefore low T in males, low E in females
- infert , absent puberty changes
- **anosmia**/hyposmia
- **renal agenesis**
- **cleft lip;/palate** 

androgen insensitivity - x linked recessive, normal androgen production, but no response, blind ended vag pouch, uterine agenesis, infertiliity, no pubic hair 
- androgen receptor gene defect 
- befoer puberty a lot of testosterone
- after puberty, LH, estrogen up and normal testosterone levels with no virilization. 

5 alpha reductase def - AR loss of function f SRD5A2 gene = 
- decrease conversion of T to DHT 
- DHT is dependent on masculinization of external genitalia and the prostate! 
- female ext genitalia with male internal genitalia at birth 
- secondary sexual male characteristics in puberty 



persistent mullerian duct syndrome - autosomal recessive mutation of AMH/AMHR2 
- dec prod of **OR** insensitivity to the anti-mullerian hormon AMH 
- AMH made by seertoli cells inside testes which suppress paramesonephric duct formation (becomes fallopian tubes, uterus, upper vagina )
- basically - male ext genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics but female internal genitalia 
- inc risk of cryptorchidism (balls don't destend) and inguinal herniation infancy 

swyer syndrome - xy gonadal dysgenesis - 
- mutations of sry , map3k1, nr5a1 , or dhh gene 
- testicular dysgenesis ,<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> streak gonads </mark>, and dec androgen production 
- female phenotype, small uterus, big clitoris, delayed puberty, absence of brest enlargement, amenorrhea

xx gonadal dysgen = bmp15 or nr5a1 gene = female phenotype, infertility, ovarian dysgenesis + streak gonads 

xy gonadal dysgen= mutation of SRY gene in chromosome Y , 
- impaired testes and therefore: 
- underprod T and AMH 
- resulting in persisting mullerian ducts -> female genitalia without ovaries 
- underdev of wolffian ducts = absence of male genitalia 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dev of streak gonads = low E and prog = neg feedback = FSH and LH up = delayed puberty + infertility</mark>
- small uterus, no breast enlargement, female phenotype typically 

imperforate hymen - failed apoptosis 
anomalies of mullerian duct fusion = defect in fusion of mullerian ducts during dev 

klinefelter syndrome= XXY + barr body 
- cause of male hypogonadism 
- nondisjunction of sex chromosomes during meiosis 
- associated with adv maternal age, 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">seminiferous tubules dysgenesis -> loss of sertoli cells -> inhibin B down, -> FSH up</mark> (FSH made and synthesized by anterior pituitary gland ... stimulating maturating germ cells)
- inhibin B = made by sertoli cells in males and ovarian granulosa cells in females that suppress release of FSH 
- leydig cells in testicular interstitium bt the seminiferous tubules would be unfunctional, so testosterone down therefore LH up (anterior pituiatary gland)
both LH and FSH going up would mean more conversion of T to E 
- gyno, no hair, testes atrophy, reduced fertility, eunuchoid growth (long slim stature bc growth plate closure delayed)
- neurocog dysfunction + mitral valve prolapse 

17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 def 
- AR of HSD17B3 which encodes this enzyme
- no conversion of androstenedione to testosterone, lowering t levels => hypoandrogenism 
- before puberty there's internal male testes, ambiguous genitalia too 
- after puberty = dev of male secondary sex charisteristics + gyno + infertility

adrenal glands 
note the right suprarenal V drains blood from it into the IVC
L suprarenal vein into the L renal V and THEN into the IVC. 
- medulla = from NCCs(chromaffin cells, secretion of **catecholamines** NE, EPI, dopamine) - made up of modded sympathetic postganglionic neurons 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tumors from here are pheochromocytomas.</mark>
catecholamine biosyn
1. phenylalnine hydroxylated into tyrosine via phenylalanine hydroxylase with cofactor THB tetrahydrobiopterin 
2. tyrosine then hydroxylated again with tyrosine hydroxylase and cofactor THB into DOPA 
3. DOPA decarboxylated by dopa decarboxylase with cofactor **B6** into dopamine 
4. dopamine then will be hydroxylated with cofactor Vita C into NEpi 
5. NEPI methylated with cofactor SAM into Epinephrine (shortest half life)
- catecholamines bind to adrenergic receptors of all types... sympathetic activation 
	- a1 = Gq = stimulation of plc -> pip2 -> ip3 and dag => more calcium inside, contraction of SM and vasoconstriction, in addition to sphincters ... located in vasculature, gi tarct and bladder 
	- a2 = Gi = inhibition of Adenylate cyclase = lower the cAMP , in the white adipose tissue, gi , bladder, and pancreas... <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">muscular contraction down, and lipolysis and insulin secretion all down</mark>
	- b1 = Gs meaning cAMP up heart and kidney, chronotrope, inotrope, and dromotropy (more conductive, contraction stronger, and more HR) as well as more renin = RAAS activation 
	- B2 = Gs cAMP up, in everything including the brnchi and uterus and skeletal muscles, vasodilation and bronchodilation, glycogenolysis up, lipolysis up, insulin secretion up, and tocolysis (<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">slowing of cervical dilation</mark>)
	- B3 = cAMP up, insid brown adipose tissue this will cause lipolysis 
	- degradation of Catecholamines is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">by COMT and MAO, which are blocked by MAO inhibitors to elevate concentration in the synaptic cleft....</mark>
	- end stage metabolite is VMA in pheochromocytoma + neuroblastoma 
- Adrenal cortex = mesoderm , production of steroid hormones ... outermost to innermost 
	- ZG - mineralocorticoids - sodium and water and potassium 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">aldosterone prod</mark>
		- pregenolone from cholesterol -> 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase makes progesterone 
		- progesterone -> 11-deoxycorticosterone via 21-hydroxylase 
		- 11-deoxycorticosterone -> corticosterone via 11b-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase 
		- corticosterone -> aldosterone 
		- MOA - binds to recetpors in the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">distal tubule and collecting duct</mark>, making protein syn + the following: 
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">rise of Na/K+ATP-ase in the membrane, making more Na+ transport out and K+ into the tubule cells.</mark>
			- more apical<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> H+/ATPase -> H+ excretion </mark>
			- more NA+ channels for ENAC, Na+ resorption 
			- K+ channels = ROMK in the luminal membrane for more K+ EXCRETION. 
			- these efffects raise bp, make hypokalemia and raise pH 
	- ZF - glucocorticoids - glucose metabolism
	- ZR - androgens 
- for cortisol and Dehydroepiandrosterone / DHEA
- CRH from the hypothalamus -> secretion of ACTH in the pituitary gland -> secreton of glucocorticoids + andorgens in the adrenla crotex 
think GFR, deeper you go, the sweeter it gets: salt, sugar, and sex 

more about RAAS
1. stimulus triggers renin secretion from the renal juxtaglomerular cells in response to low bp, b-1 adrenergic activation and NaCl deficiency to secure a more stable GFR 
2. renin promotes conversion of angioteniogen made in liver to angiotensin I 
3. AT1 turned to AT2 via angiotensin converting enzyme 
4. AT2 causes <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">vasoconstriction, triggering secretion of aldosterone</mark>
- too high serum K+ = stimulation of ZG, meaning more secretion of aldosterone 
- negative feedback: if BP gets too high, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ANP is released from atrial myocytes -> **inhibition of renin release** -> vasodilation, natriuresis + up more diuresis!!!</mark>
- inhibitors of ACE - angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor: -**pril** , for htn and dm and HFREF, and Hx of MI 
	- no more converting at1 to at2, so AT2 down!!! 
	- GFR going down due to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dilation of efferent arteriole</mark> -> inc in renin secretion due to this -> AT1 up. 
	- more bradykinin breakdown -> vasodilation -> BP down 
		- dry cough , and angioedema 
		- hyperkalemia too due to RAAS overactivation , and GFR down which means more creatinine = AKI 
	- this does cause protinuria, so preogression of proteinuric CKD goes down 
	- teratogen 
- ARBs - blocking the angiotensin receptors -**sartans** 
	- 2nd line if ace not tolerated 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">notably no bradykinin elevation.</mark>
	- teratogen
	- still angioedema's possible 
- ARNIs - angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors 
	- sacubitril / valsartan 
	- impairs the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">breakdown of at2, substance P and natriuretic peptides, meaning natiuresis, diuresis. + vasodilation.</mark>
	- stage C or D HFrEF 
	- teratogen 
- direct renin inhibitor = aliskiren - for arterial htn if neither are tolerated 
	- teratogen 


glucocorticoid synthesis!!! 
from pregnenolone pathway.... 
1. using 17a-hydroxylase to make 17-hydroxypregnenolone 
	1. then: 17-hydroxypregnenolone turns into 17-hydroxyprogesterone with the enzyme 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. 
2. using 2b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to make progesterone 
	1. then: progesterone turns into 17-hydroxyprogesterone with using 17a-hydroxylase enzyme. 
3. common pathway: 
	1. 17-hydroxyprogesterone turns into 11-deoxycortisol via using enzyme 21-hydroxylase 
	2. 11-deoxycortisol will then be made into cortisol via enzyme 11-b-hydroxylase 
cortisol will 
- inc gluconeogenesis
- glycogen synthesis
- protein catabolism (resulting in muscular atrophy)
- lipolysis 
- appetite up 
- insulin resistance 
- and antiinflammatory/immunosuppressive effects 
- wound healing down via fibroblast inhibition 
- ultimately with more CRH -> ACTH -> glucocorticoid secretion up .... 
	- CRH triggers are: pain and stress, epinephrine, histamine, hypoglycemia, hypotension 

androgen synthesis 
from pregnenolone pathway.... 
1. using 17a-hydroxylase to make 17-hydroxypregnenolone 
	1. then: 17-hydroxypregnenolone turns into DHEA or dehydroepiandrosterone with the enzyme 17,20-lyase
2. with progesterone, using 17a-hydroxylase to make 17-hydroxyprogesterone 
	1. then: 17-hydroxyprogesterone turns into **androstenedione** with using 17,20-lyase enzyme. 
	2. this same hormones also made in the gonads (regulated by ACTH in the adrenal, but gonadotropins in the gonads.)
	3. the androstenedione -> testosterone -> DHT via 5a-reductase (the inhibitors for this is used in treating BPH)
meanwhile aromatase converts T into E and androstenedione, which is then transfrmed into estrone. 
- DHT = prostate, penis, scrotum differentiation 
- T = epididymis, vas def, seminal vesicles

blood pressure regulation
- barorecptors - stretch - wall of carotid sinus, ao arch, atria, vena cavas.... 
	- bp down -> firing req lowers, -> brain stem vasomotor center signalling down -> parasympathetic stimulation lowers and sympathetic up -> vasoconstriction -> HR , SV and BP up 
	- bp up -> baroreceptor firing up -> baroreceptor reflex in vasomotor center of stem -> parasympathetic up and sympathetic down etc. 
	- these are only for short term changes like acute hemorrhage... 
- cushing reflex -> icp up -> compensatory constriction of cerebral arterioles - > perfusion down -> hypercapnia(elevation of CO2 above 45 mmhg in arterial blood!!!) + acidosis -> chemoreceptor mediated sympathetic response -> bp up -> stimulation of ao arch baroreceptors -> vagal activation -> **reflex bradycardia!!!**

volume receptors are like releasing based on flow changes in pulm circulation, releasing ANP and ADH etc. 

chemoreceptors - detect pH changes and resp gases which regulate pH, o2 and co2 
	peripheral chemoreceptors - in the carotid body + aortic body, measuring PaO2 <60 mmHg, CO2 and pH 
	central chemoreceptors = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">medulla oblongata</mark> - measures PaCO2 and pH of Cerebral interstitial fluid 
		less sensitive to PO2 lvls, become <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">desensitized in response to chronic hypoxia/hypercapnia like in COPD</mark>
basically CO2 up , O2 down, and pH down = sympathetic innervation up 
- this modulates breathing in resp center of medulla 
- carotid massage = stimulation of baroreceptors in carotid sinus, to reduce HR by inc the refactory period of AV node... 

central bp regulation - in solitary nucleus of medulla oblongata 
- gets afferent info from CN IX from carotid sinus + carotid body chemoreceptor and CN X from ao chemo and baroreceptor and atrial vol receptors 
- sends info via <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sympathetic cervical chain + sympathetic fibers to vessels and SA + AV node.</mark>
- parasympathetic information to CN X to AV node and SA node 

myogenic autoregulation - myocytes in arteries + arterioles reacting to bp changes to maintain constant flow in vessels. 
- in all organs except the lungs 
- NO 
	- made in endothelium by no-synthase from arg -> vasodilation , triggered by inc in BP, activation of enodthelial receptors by vasoactive substance binding like serotonin, bradykinin 
	- and histamine, prostaglandins, thromboxane. 
heart autoreg
- adenosine + NO = vasoodilation of coronary arteries for inc blood flw + o2 delivery 
in lungs
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hypoventilation -> vasoconstriction </mark> - very unique for this! this is to ensure that perfusion only happens in areas that are well-ventilated.

myostatic stretch reflex 
- afferent signals via type Ia fibers + type II fibers and the dorsal root ganglion to the spinal cord 
	- muscle spindles are also innervated by type 2 fibers which transmit info about static muscle legnth, not dynamic length changes
	- activation of: alpha motor neurons - innervate agonist muscle = mnosynaptic AND inhibitoory interneurons which inhibit the alpha motor neurons of the antag muscle (disynaptic 
	- this causes the muscle which is stretched to contract 
- golgi tendon organ inverse myostatic stretch reflex 
	- in the tendons of skeletal muscle 
	- afferent signals travel thru the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">type Ib sensory fibers + dorsal root ganglion to the spinal cord</mark>
	- activate inhibitory intrneurons that inhbiit the alpha motor neurons of agonist muscle = dysynaptic 
	- relaxation of the agonist muscle preventing exhaustive tension 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">causes muscle relaxation of agonist muscle before tendon dmg occurs. this is the sudden releaxation when weightliter uses very heavy weight</mark>

deep tendon reflexes = ipsilateral, monosynaptic, 
- afferent: sensory neuron from muscle spindles to spinal cord
- efferent limb = lower motor neuron, from SC to the NMJ 
- biceps, brachioradialis = C5-6 
-  triceps = C7-8 
- quadriceps; knee reflex = L3-4 
- gastrocnemius ; ankle reflex/achilles = S1-2 
- cremaster = L1-2 
- ext anal sphincter ; anal wink reflex S3-5 
S1,2 buckle my shoe (ankle), L2-4, kick the door (knee), C5-6, pick up sticks (with biceps and brachioradialis/arms) C7-8, lay them straight (triceps) , L1-2 testicle move, S3-5 winking dive.

embrology of SC
- neurulation = 3rd week , neural plate folds at midline to fuse and make the neural tube 
- notochord - induces overlying ectoderm -> neuroectoderm, making the neural plate on day 18 .... (derivative of the nucleus pulposus of intervrtebral disc)
- neural plate on the dorsal portion of trilaminar germ disk would then make neural tube 
- neural folds grow dorsally to the midline, fusing to make it , -> derivative of NCCs
- NCCs will transition from epithelial to mesenchymal -> dorsal rooot ganglia, autonomic ganglia, schwann cells, adrenal medulla 
- Neural tube = 2 plates
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">alar = dorsal , regulated by TGF-b family proteins bone morphogenetic protein, and BASAL / ventral regulated by sonic hedgehog protein</mark>
		- TGF-beta - immune cell , and growth factors which induce formation of bone + cartilage = ALAR = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sensory neurons</mark>
		- sonic hedgehog - maintaining limb polarity in the embryo ; and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">basal plate gives rise to motor neurons</mark>

central cord syndrome - lesion near central canal of SC, with hyperextension of neck, syringomyelia and other tumors
- selective dmg = motor weakness, loss pain, temp sensation in upper limbs and trunk 
- anterior cord syndrome - anterior 2/3 usually ASC occlusion, complete bilateral paralysis + loss of pain and temp below the lesion, with spaired vib/proprioception due to spared dorsal column. 
- posterior cord syndrome - loss proprioception, vib sensation + touch discrimination. also caused by B12 deficiency 
- brown-sequard syndrome - hemisection of SC, half gone. ipsilateral loss prooprioception, tactile discrimination + vibration and ipsilateral flaccid paralysis + <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">contralateral loss of pain + temp</mark>
- syringomyelia - fluid filled cavity in the central canal of the SC, result of bad CSF drainage from central canal most likely caused by chiari malform or previous trauma
