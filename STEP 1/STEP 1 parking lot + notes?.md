cushing syndrome - can be caused by exogenous glucocorticoid administration or endogenous cortisol overproduction 
- midnight salivary cortisol - 
- exogenous / iatrogenic cushing 
	- prolonged glucocorticoids -> hypercortisolism -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">decreased ACTH -> bilateral adrenal atrophy</mark>
- endogenous - priamry hypercortisolism 
	- ACTH-independent, autonomous overproduction of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cortisol by adrenal gland -> ACTH suppression -> atrophy of CONTRALATERAL adrenal gland.</mark>
- secondary hypercortisolism 
	- pituitary adenomas - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cushing DISEASE... -> ACTH secretion high -> bilateral adrenal gland hyperplasia</mark>
	- ectopic ACTH  prod from a paraneoplastic syndrome like small cell lung cancer or lung NE tumors. -> ACTH high -> bilateral adrenal gland hyperplasia again. 
- skin - stretch marks, hirsutism, acne, thin, easily bruisable skin , hyperpigmentation if secondary due to melanin over product
	- excessive acth production bc melanocyte-stimlating hormone is cleaved from the same precursor POMC - not a feature of primary hypercortisolism 
typically - hypenatremia, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis 
- 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase converts cortisol to cortisone - preventing cortisol from binding to the renal mineralocorticoid receptor 
	- if cortisol surge, 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase gets saturated, 
	- excess cortisol is free to bind to mineralocorticoid receptor - causing increased water sodium retention and inc K+/H+ excretion 
- free urine cortisol found 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">low dose dexamethasone suppression test. -if you give small dose of glucocorticoids, you would see higher serum cortisol</mark>
number one - measure serum ACTH levels 
- low = suspect primary hypercortisolism !!! overproduction of cortisol 
	- accss for adrenal tumor or otherwise, and see if contralateral to the tumor its atrophic bc of reduced acth 
- if you see inappropriately normal or elevated ACTH, suspect secondary hypercortisolism 
	- pituitary MRI = adenoma will confirm it 
hypothalamus -> CRH -> pituitary -> ACTH -> adrenal gland -> cortisol

- warfarin therapy is usually indicated in DVTs, but not given to pregnant women bc it crosses placenta + teratogen 

alteplase = conversion plasminogen to plasmin... which will break down clots 
- for thrombolysis in pts with acute ischemic stroke and ST-elevation MIs. 
- this is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">iv recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, tPA.</mark>
- aspirin 24-48 symptom onset bc it's to prevent it, it's antiplatelet therapy 

paradoxical embolism - venous thromboembolism like due to DVT esp, in patients with a R-> L cardiac shunt like in ASD or persistent foramen ovale -> paradoxical embolism goes to the head passing from RA -> LA-> cerebral arterial system 
- from leg-> IVC -> RA -> ASD -> LA-> LV-> aorta !!!! 

fresh frozen plasma - which contains all coagulation factors, can be used in managing major bleeding after warfarin use.... 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this is not given to her bc it's teratogenic. and this is not used to reverse this heparin toxicity bc FFP also has antithrombin... alr activted in the presence heparin and inhibit activity of other coag factors.</mark>

dev of repro system? 
weeks 7-8 = diff of mesonephric + paramesonephric ducts begin 
- both are there at first 
- in males: MIF <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">mullerian inhibitory factor from sertoli cells</mark> -> degen of paramesonephric ducts -> **appendix testis**
	- "leydig cells Lead to male diff, Sertoli cells Suppress female diff?"
	- SEED = mesoneprhic duct = seminal vesicles, epididymis, ejac duct, ductus defs
- then Leydig cells make T -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">differentiation of mesoneprhic duct into male internal genitalia except prostate</mark>
- in female : default phenotype and absence of MIF means paramesophric ducts turn into female internal genitalia like fallopian tubes, uterus, prox vagina ... and the mesonephric ducts dege into <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">gartner ducts with absence of T</mark>
wk 12 = ext genitalia 
wk 20 - phenotypic diff complete

urogenital folds
- ventral penile shaft + penile urethra
- labia minora
labioscrotal swelling
- scrotum 
- labia majora 

gonads must migrade caudally from their initial retroperitoneal location thru inguinal ring into scrotum 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">gubernaculum induces intraabdominal migration = gubernaculum is a band of tissue that then becomes the scrotal ligament in men and the ovarian + round ligament of uterus in women</mark>
- inc in Intra abd pressure forces them thru inguinal canal 
- gubernaculum regresses 
processus vaginalis - evagination of peritoneum accompanying the testis into scrotum before closing -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">turns into the tunica vaginalis but is obliterated in the female.</mark>
- in males - failure to close or patent processus vaginalis = hydrocele or <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">indirect inguinal hernia</mark>

![[biosyn of adrenal steroid hormones.png]]
congenital adrenal hyperplasia - autosomal recessive gene mutation of enzymes responsible for cortisol, aldosterone and sometimes androgens. 
all forms have: 
	low cortisol(ZF of adrenal cortex) -> lack of negative pituitary feedback -> 
	 increased ACTH (anterior pituitary gland, stimulating glucocorticoids + androgen secretion in adrenal cortex) 
		 - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">note about this - Melanocyte stimulating hormone is cleaved from ACTH's precursor so HYPERPIGMENTATION in areas!</mark>
	 -> adrenal **hyperplasia**  + inc synthesis of adrenal precursor steroids 
	 - chance of getting adrenal crisis due to low glucocorticoids !! fever , abd pain, n/v , impaired consciousness, shock 
- 21-hydroxylase = most common 
	- h**ypo**tension = saltwasting of hypoaldosteronism + hypocortisolism 
	- precocious puberty in boys + female pseudohermaphroditism !!! and or male genitalia along with female testes 
	- virilization. 
	- 11-Deoxycorticosterone DOC goes <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">down, as a compound formed from progesterone by this enzyme!!!</mark>
		- has some mineralcorticoid activity , as a mineralcorticoid precursor <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">which leads to the suppression of RAAS usually resulting from low aldosterone lvls</mark>
		- we basically losing a lot of water and salts = hypotension 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fludrocortisone therapy as aldosterone substitution</mark>
- 17a-hydroxylase
	- htn, in *spite* of hypoaldosteronism due to DOC activity 
	- delayed puberty in girls , normal fem genitalia at birth 
	- in boys, female genitalia with blind ending pouch + testes inside. 
	- 11-deoxycorticosterone goes UP 
	- spironolactone = to block mineralocorticoid receptors 
- 11b-hydroxylase 
	- hypertension 
	- similar deal to the precocious puberty in boys + female pseudohermaphroditism !!! and or male genitalia along with female testes , virilization!
	- precocious puberty in boys 
	- spironolactone = to block mineralocorticoid receptors 
- this would inc or dec the androgen production 
think = one doc.... if deficient enzyme starts with 1 there's increased doctor 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">AND one = if it ends with 1 , androgens are INC!!!</mark>



aromatase def = CYP19A1 gene mutation AR, 
- defective/absent **aromatase** 
	- -> lower conversion of testosterone to estrogen -> serum e falls with rising testosterone 
- dec estrogen + inc androgens 
- in girls, ambiguous ext genitalia with normal internal, virilization, amenorrhea 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">maternal virilization during pregnancy due to fetal androgens crossing placenta....</mark>
- post birth = testosterone up, androstenedione(intermediate in biosynthesis of estrone + testosterone released by the adrenal gland) up, e down. 
- impaired maturation of secondary sex characteristics in females 
- hyperglycemia + weight gain + fatty liver (insulin impaired tissue response to it)
- tall due to excessive bone growth with slowed mineralization, osteoporosis 

ovotesticular disorder - SRY gene translocation from Y to X chromosome 
- in XY ppl - hypospadias, cryptochidism, testicular enlargement, gyno
- mixed testicular + ovarian dysgenesis 
- ovotestis = ambiguous genitalia 
- 
- 

kallmann syndrome - multiple gene mutations that are responsible for migrating GnRH releasing neurons from olfactory 
- hypogonadotropic hypogonadism  = pituitary gonadotropins FSH and LH low and subsequently low E and T.... 
- defective GnRH releasing neurons from olfactory bulbs from bad migration to the hypothalamic preoptic nuclei = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">GnRH secretion down, underdev of olfactory bulbs</mark> => therefore low pituitary secreton of FSH/LH therefore low T in males, low E in females
- infert , absent puberty changes
- **anosmia**/hyposmia
- **renal agenesis**
- **cleft lip;/palate** 

androgen insensitivity - x linked recessive, normal androgen production, but no response, blind ended vag pouch, uterine agenesis, infertiliity, no pubic hair 
- androgen receptor gene defect 
- befoer puberty a lot of testosterone
- after puberty, LH, estrogen up and normal testosterone levels with no virilization. 

5 alpha reductase def - AR loss of function f SRD5A2 gene = 
- decrease conversion of T to DHT 
- DHT is dependent on masculinization of external genitalia and the prostate! 
- female ext genitalia with male internal genitalia at birth 
- secondary sexual male characteristics in puberty 



persistent mullerian duct syndrome - autosomal recessive mutation of AMH/AMHR2 
- dec prod of **OR** insensitivity to the anti-mullerian hormon AMH 
- AMH made by seertoli cells inside testes which suppress paramesonephric duct formation (becomes fallopian tubes, uterus, upper vagina )
- basically - male ext genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics but female internal genitalia 
- inc risk of cryptorchidism (balls don't destend) and inguinal herniation infancy 

swyer syndrome - xy gonadal dysgenesis - 
- mutations of sry , map3k1, nr5a1 , or dhh gene 
- testicular dysgenesis ,<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> streak gonads </mark>, and dec androgen production 
- female phenotype, small uterus, big clitoris, delayed puberty, absence of brest enlargement, amenorrhea

xx gonadal dysgen = bmp15 or nr5a1 gene = female phenotype, infertility, ovarian dysgenesis + streak gonads 

xy gonadal dysgen= mutation of SRY gene in chromosome Y , 
- impaired testes and therefore: 
- underprod T and AMH 
- resulting in persisting mullerian ducts -> female genitalia without ovaries 
- underdev of wolffian ducts = absence of male genitalia 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dev of streak gonads = low E and prog = neg feedback = FSH and LH up = delayed puberty + infertility</mark>
- small uterus, no breast enlargement, female phenotype typically 

imperforate hymen - failed apoptosis 
anomalies of mullerian duct fusion = defect in fusion of mullerian ducts during dev 

klinefelter syndrome= XXY + barr body 
- cause of male hypogonadism 
- nondisjunction of sex chromosomes during meiosis 
- associated with adv maternal age, 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">seminiferous tubules dysgenesis -> loss of sertoli cells -> inhibin B down, -> FSH up</mark> (FSH made and synthesized by anterior pituitary gland ... stimulating maturating germ cells)
- inhibin B = made by sertoli cells in males and ovarian granulosa cells in females that suppress release of FSH 
- leydig cells in testicular interstitium bt the seminiferous tubules would be unfunctional, so testosterone down therefore LH up (anterior pituiatary gland)
both LH and FSH going up would mean more conversion of T to E 
- gyno, no hair, testes atrophy, reduced fertility, eunuchoid growth (long slim stature bc growth plate closure delayed)
- neurocog dysfunction + mitral valve prolapse 

17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 def 
- AR of HSD17B3 which encodes this enzyme
- no conversion of androstenedione to testosterone, lowering t levels => hypoandrogenism 
- before puberty there's internal male testes, ambiguous genitalia too 
- after puberty = dev of male secondary sex charisteristics + gyno + infertility

adrenal glands 
note the right suprarenal V drains blood from it into the IVC
L suprarenal vein into the L renal V and THEN into the IVC. 
- medulla = from NCCs(chromaffin cells, secretion of **catecholamines** NE, EPI, dopamine) - made up of modded sympathetic postganglionic neurons

catecholamine biosyn
1. phenylalnine hydroxylated into tyrosine via phenylalanine hydroxylase with cofactor THB tetrahydrobiopterin 
2. tyrosine then hydroxylated again with tyrosine hydroxylase and cofactor THB into DOPA 
3. DOPA decarboxylated by dopa decarboxylase with cofactor **B6** into dopamine 
4. dopamine then will be hydroxylated with cofactor Vita C into NEpi 
5. NEPI methylated with cofactor SAM into Epinephrine (shortest half life)
- catecholamines bind to adrenergic receptors of all types... sympathetic activation 
	- a1 = Gq = stimulation of plc -> pip2 -> ip3 and dag => more calcium inside, contraction of SM and vasoconstriction, in addition to sphincters ... located in vasculature, gi tarct and bladder 
	- a2 = Gi = inhibition of Adenylate cyclase = lower the cAMP , in the white adipose tissue, gi , bladder, and pancreas... <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">muscular contraction down, and lipolysis and insulin secretion all down</mark>
	- b1 = Gs meaning cAMP up heart and kidney, chronotrope, inotrope, and dromotropy (more conductive, contraction stronger, and more HR) as well as more renin = RAAS activation 
	- B2 = Gs cAMP up, in everything including the brnchi and uterus and skeletal muscles, vasodilation and bronchodilation, glycogenolysis up, lipolysis up, insulin secretion up, and tocolysis (<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">slowing of cervical dilation</mark>)
	- B3 = cAMP up, insid brown adipose tissue this will cause lipolysis 
	- degradation of Catecholamines is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">by COMT and MAO, which are blocked by MAO inhibitors to elevate concentration in the synaptic cleft....</mark>
	- end stage metabolite is VMA in pheochromocytoma + neuroblastoma 
- Adrenal cortex = mesoderm , production of steroid hormones ... outermost to innermost 
	- ZG - mineralocorticoids - sodium and water and potassium 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">aldosterone prod</mark>
		- pregenolone from cholesterol -> 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase makes progesterone 
		- progesterone -> 11-deoxycorticosterone via 21-hydroxylase 
		- 11-deoxycorticosterone -> corticosterone via 11b-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase 
		- corticosterone -> aldosterone 
		- MOA - binds to recetpors in the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">distal tubule and collecting duct</mark>, making protein syn + the following: 
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">rise of Na/K+ATP-ase in the membrane, making more Na+ transport out and K+ into the tubule cells.</mark>
			- more apical<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> H+/ATPase -> H+ excretion </mark>
			- more NA+ channels for ENAC, Na+ resorption 
			- K+ channels = ROMK in the luminal membrane for more K+ EXCRETION. 
			- these efffects raise bp, make hypokalemia and raise pH 
	- ZF - glucocorticoids - glucose metabolism
	- ZR - androgens 
- for cortisol and Dehydroepiandrosterone / DHEA
- CRH from the hypothalamus -> secretion of ACTH in the pituitary gland -> secreton of glucocorticoids + andorgens in the adrenla crotex 
think GFR, deeper you go, the sweeter it gets: salt, sugar, and sex 

more about RAAS
1. stimulus triggers renin secretion from the renal juxtaglomerular cells in response to low bp, b-1 adrenergic activation and NaCl deficiency to secure a more stable GFR 
2. renin promotes conversion of angioteniogen made in liver to angiotensin I 
3. AT1 turned to AT2 via angiotensin converting enzyme 
4. AT2 causes <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">vasoconstriction, triggering secretion of aldosterone</mark>
- too high serum K+ = stimulation of ZG, meaning more secretion of aldosterone 
- negative feedback: if BP gets too high, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ANP is released from atrial myocytes -> **inhibition of renin release** -> vasodilation, natriuresis + up more diuresis!!!</mark>
- inhibitors of ACE - angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor: -**pril** , for htn and dm and HFREF, and Hx of MI 
	- no more converting at1 to at2, so AT2 down!!! 
	- GFR going down due to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dilation of efferent arteriole</mark> -> inc in renin secretion due to this -> AT1 up. 
	- more bradykinin breakdown -> vasodilation -> BP down 
		- dry cough , and angioedema 
		- hyperkalemia too due to RAAS overactivation , and GFR down which means more creatinine = AKI 
	- this does cause protinuria, so preogression of proteinuric CKD goes down 
	- teratogen 
- ARBs - blocking the angiotensin receptors -**sartans** 
	- 2nd line if ace not tolerated 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">notably no bradykinin elevation.</mark>

	- sacubitril / valsartan 
	- impairs the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">breakdown of at2, substance P and natriuretic peptides, meaning natiuresis, diuresis. + vasodilation.</mark>
	- stage C or D HFrEF

glucocorticoid synthesis!!! 
from pregnenolone pathway.... 
1. using 17a-hydroxylase to make 17-hydroxypregnenolone 
	1. then: 17-hydroxypregnenolone turns into 17-hydroxyprogesterone with the enzyme 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. 
2. using 2b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to make progesterone 
	1. then: progesterone turns into 17-hydroxyprogesterone with using 17a-hydroxylase enzyme. 
3. common pathway: 
	1. 17-hydroxyprogesterone turns into 11-deoxycortisol via using enzyme 21-hydroxylase 
	2. 11-deoxycortisol will then be made into cortisol via enzyme 11-b-hydroxylase 
cortisol will 
- inc gluconeogenesis
- glycogen synthesis
- protein catabolism (resulting in muscular atrophy)
- lipolysis 
- appetite up 
- insulin resistance 
- and antiinflammatory/immunosuppressive effects 
- wound healing down via fibroblast inhibition 
- ultimately with more CRH -> ACTH -> glucocorticoid secretion up .... 
	- CRH triggers are: pain and stress, epinephrine, histamine, hypoglycemia, hypotension 

androgen synthesis 
from pregnenolone pathway.... 
1. using 17a-hydroxylase to make 17-hydroxypregnenolone 
	1. then: 17-hydroxypregnenolone turns into DHEA or dehydroepiandrosterone with the enzyme 17,20-lyase
2. with progesterone, using 17a-hydroxylase to make 17-hydroxyprogesterone 
	1. then: 17-hydroxyprogesterone turns into **androstenedione** with using 17,20-lyase enzyme. 
	2. this same hormones also made in the gonads (regulated by ACTH in the adrenal, but gonadotropins in the gonads.)
	3. the androstenedione -> testosterone -> DHT via 5a-reductase (the inhibitors for this is used in treating BPH)
meanwhile aromatase converts T into E and androstenedione, which is then transfrmed into estrone. 
- DHT = prostate, penis, scrotum differentiation 
- T = epididymis, vas def, seminal vesicles

blood pressure regulation
- barorecptors - stretch - wall of carotid sinus, ao arch, atria, vena cavas.... 
	- bp down -> firing req lowers, -> brain stem vasomotor center signalling down -> parasympathetic stimulation lowers and sympathetic up -> vasoconstriction -> HR , SV and BP up 
	- bp up -> baroreceptor firing up -> baroreceptor reflex in vasomotor center of stem -> parasympathetic up and sympathetic down etc. 
	- these are only for short term changes like acute hemorrhage... 
- cushing reflex -> icp up -> compensatory constriction of cerebral arterioles - > perfusion down -> hypercapnia(elevation of CO2 above 45 mmhg in arterial blood!!!) + acidosis -> chemoreceptor mediated sympathetic response -> bp up -> stimulation of ao arch baroreceptors -> vagal activation -> **reflex bradycardia!!!**

volume receptors are like releasing based on flow changes in pulm circulation, releasing ANP and ADH etc. 

chemoreceptors - detect pH changes and resp gases which regulate pH, o2 and co2

		less sensitive to PO2 lvls, become <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">desensitized in response to chronic hypoxia/hypercapnia like in COPD</mark>
basically CO2 up , O2 down, and pH down = sympathetic innervation up 
- this modulates breathing in resp center of medulla 
- carotid massage = stimulation of baroreceptors in carotid sinus, to reduce HR by inc the refactory period of AV node... 

central bp regulation - in solitary nucleus of medulla oblongata 
- gets afferent info from CN IX from carotid sinus + carotid body chemoreceptor and CN X from ao chemo and baroreceptor and atrial vol receptors 
- sends info via <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sympathetic cervical chain + sympathetic fibers to vessels and SA + AV node.</mark>
- parasympathetic information to CN X to AV node and SA node 

myogenic autoregulation - myocytes in arteries + arterioles reacting to bp changes to maintain constant flow in vessels. 
- in all organs except the lungs 
- NO 
	- made in endothelium by no-synthase from arg -> vasodilation , triggered by inc in BP, activation of enodthelial receptors by vasoactive substance binding like serotonin, bradykinin 
	- and histamine, prostaglandins, thromboxane. 
heart autoreg
- adenosine + NO = vasoodilation of coronary arteries for inc blood flw + o2 delivery 
in lungs
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hypoventilation -> vasoconstriction </mark> - very unique for this! this is to ensure that perfusion only happens in areas that are well-ventilated.

	- hemoglobins in urine and hemosiderin in urine.... with filtered hb reabsorbed by proximal convoluted tubule -> hemic iron removed + stored as hemosiderin -> hemosiderin proximal tubule cells put into the urine 
- extravascular hemolytic anemia - inc destrution of RBCs by the **reticuloendothelial system like the spleen**
	- RBC defects like sickle cells, spherocytosis, pyruvate kinase def
	- and antibody-mediated hemolysis like warm and cold agglutinin disease. 
	-  haptoglobin down, this is when hb is released from RBC breakdown binding to this haptoglobin meaning it's bound and goes down 
	- lactate dehydrogenase goes up 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">indirect unconjugated bilirubin = more prominent in this one, where Hb is released, and then the heme is catabolized to indirect bilirubin</mark>
	- Spherocytes are seen in hereditary spherocytosis , rbc <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">in cold agglutinin disease</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">target cells in sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and hemoglobin C disease</mark>
	- teardrop cells in thalassemia 
	- urobilinogen - with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inc indirect bilirubin -> bilirubin breakdown in gut -> more urobilinogen reabsorption into enterohepatic circulation -> excess urobilinogen getting into urine</mark>
hemolysis with jaundice, pigemnted gallstones and hemoglobinuria 
- CBC hb, hct and rbc count all down 
- normocytosis in most hemolytic anemias
- MCV up due to reticulocytosis = where reticulocytes are bigger than normal RBCS
- microcytosis = consider thalassemia and or iron deficiency 
coombs testing 
- coombs serum added to patient blood samples which has antihuman globulins - AHGs which detect + adhere to immune proteins that mediate hemolysis like igG or complement
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">rbc agglutination = poz result, and absence of rbc agglutination is considered a negative result...</mark>
- direct
	- detect antibodies/complement in surface of RBCs
	- only RBCs are in the patient sample , they add coombs serum, and then agglutinates witth the complement and antibodies that are already present on the surface rbc 
	- poz = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">rbcs coated with autoantibodies + complement that are cuasing hemlysis.</mark>
	- autoimmune hemolytic anemia (warm or cold)
	- hemolytic dz of the newborn 
- indirect
	- detection of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anti-RBC antibodies in the serum of patients</mark>
	- for anyone needing pretransfusion testing + transfusion reactions. 
	- screening for Rh-negative mothers to determine if anti-D immunoglobulin is indicated 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">only serum remains, and then patient serum incubaed with Test RBCs... if there's antibodies in the patient it'll bind and then agglutinate.</mark>
1. pyruvate kinase deficiency - AR defect of pyruvate kinase, absence of this -> ATP deficiency in RBC
	1. ATP def disrupts the cation gradient -> rigid RBCs-> extravascular hemolysis 
	2. typically newborn jaundice + hydrops fetalis in rare cases. 
	3. burr cells , need phototherapy 
2. Hgb C disease 
	1. homozygous ppl for this... 
	2. glutamic acid is replaced with lys, making hgb C, 
	3. precipitates as crystals -> extarvascular hemolysis bc of rbc rigidity up 
	4. b-globin mutation -
microangiopathic hemolytic anemias
- primary MAHAs - TTP, HUS
- sedondary - autooimmune dz, HELLP , htn , DIC, drug induced hemolytic anemia 
- cbc - anemia + thrombocytopenia , negative DAT , and PBS shows shcistocytes

pharm fundamentals 
LADME - phases of pharmacokinetcis
- Liberation - release from pharm form 
- Absorption - how it reaches bloodstream... like with 
	- F = bioavailability - rate and concentration at which it reaches circulation , percentage
	- Area under curve of concentration vs time 
	- first pass via thru the GI tract and then reaching the liver, and then the liver it undergoes first pass metabolism, lowering the F of the drug 
	- lipophilic drugs undergo biotransformation in liver to become more hydrophilic in 2 phases. excreted biliary elim without biotransformation. 
	- hydrophiliic drugs - are transported with predominantly polar compounds, and then facilitated support, which are later excreted renally 
- Distribution- distribution coefficient is hydrophobicity / hydrophilicity of the drug reprecented by concentrations 
	- vol of distribution V = M(amt of drug in body) / C(concentration of drug in plasma)
	- Vd is low = meaning consisting of large molecules, ions, binding to plasma proteins. and is intracellular 
	- Vd high if made of small lipophillic moelcuels and binds to tissue proteins. in the muscle , adipose tissue etc. 
- Metabolism - biotransformation in the liver mainly 
	- zeroo order - rate of metab/elim stays same indpendent of concentration , capcity limited 
		- ethanol, phenytoin, aspirin 
	- first order - directly proportional, flow dependent 
	- phase 1 rxn - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">drug transform into polar, water soluble metabolite by cytochrome P450 via oxidation/reduction/hydroolysis</mark>
	- phase 2 rxn - drug is conugated and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">transformed into veryyy polar metabolite to excrete renally via glucuronidation, acetylation, sulfation, methylation</mark>
- Excretion = CL = Vd * K (elimination constant)
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">time to reach 1 half life = (.7*Vd) / CL </mark>
- **complete steady state takes 4-5 half lives!!!** and after 4 half lives mroe than 90% of drug is elminated. 
- ionized substances can't cross renal tubular membranes and are cleared quick like weak acids and bases (phenoobarbital, methtrexate, aspirin, and bases like tricyclic antidepressants + amphetamines)
	- clear acidic oes with alkalinization of urine 
	- and acidification of urine iwth ammonium chloride for instenace 
loading dose = Cp * Vd / F
	Cp = target peak plasma concentration at steady state 
maintenance doese  = (Cp * CL * tau ) /F
	CL = clearnce 
	tau = dosing interval (in hours)
potency - EC50 = potency = concentration to make pharm response of an intensity, like 50% of the max pssible one 
Efficacy = 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Therapeutic index = TD50 / ED50 </mark>
research: 
phase 0 = exploratory, no therapeutic or dx intent, gaining insight on pharmacokinetics/dyanmics, small sample of healthy ppl or population with dz of interest 
phase 1 = eval of pharmacodynam/kinetic properties, and **safety** and **toxicity** ... still small similar number 
phase 2 = moderate number of pts with specific dz, eval efficacy , optimal dose range, SEs
phase 3 = final confirm safety/eval of efficacy against **placebo or current Standard of care.** - randomized control trial with a lot of patients 
phase 4 trial - postmarketing surveillance - and safety studies following approval with large amts of patients, open label again

ARDs
- tissue dmg -> inflam mediators like IL-1 -> rxn -> migrate neutrophils into alveoli -> release of neutrophilic mediators like cytokines, ROS, -> injury to alveolar capilaries + endothelial cells = diffuse alveolar dmg DAD
	- exudative phase - excess fluid = pulm edema with norml pulm capillary wedge pressure -> dec lung compliance + resp distress
	- hyaline membrane formation = exudation of neutrophils + protein rich fluid into alveolar space = hyaline membranes = impaired gas exchange = hypoxemia -> resp alkalosis due to hyperventilation compensation.... and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">chronic hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction -> pulm hytn and right to left pulm shunt</mark>
	- also dmg to type 1 + 2 pneumocytes(secretes surfactants) -> dec surfactant => alveolar collapse -> intrapulm shunting 
	- in the late/organizing phase = proliferation of tpe 2 pneumocytes + infiltrating fibroblasts mean progressive interstitial fibrosis 
- this is an dx of exclusion , usually triggered by sepsis, and bilateral opacities seen on xray and ct 
- hypoxemia = pao2/FiO2 < 300 mmHG = arterial o2/ fraction of oxygen in ninspired air
- initially we get respiratory alkalosis 
- TREAT: with ventilation and then underlying cause

![[coagulation cascade]]
protamine sulfate - can neutralize a bunch of heparin in heparin induced stufff.... 

unfractionated heparin - enhances activity of antithrombin .... which is anticoag protein made by liver that inhibits thrombin and other facotrsl. 
- factor Xa s inhibited, decrease prothrombin activation 
- thrombin factor 2a is impacted, where unfractionated hepatin and htrombin binds it with antithrombin III .... 
- these cause more bleeding. short half life this one 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this treatment can cause thrombocytopenia</mark> = HIT heparin inhduced.... 
low molecular weight heparin and synthetic heparin 
- lmwh = binds antithrombin III => inhib factor Xa 
- synthetic heparin only selectively binds to antithrombin III more selective inhibt Xa 
- longer half life, more bioavaliability 

direct thrombin inhbitiros 
- directly inhibit freely ciruclating and in association with clots thrombin . 
- use to treat heparin induced thrombocytopenia

day 0 - 
- capacitation - maturation of sperm in female genital tract
- conception/fertilization happens most commonly n the ampulla of the fallopian tubes (the middle part), within 1 day of ovulation 
	- acrosome rxn = dissolution of sperm cell membrane + zona pellucida of ovum 
	- impregnantion - pentration of sperm into the ovum 
- conjugation - fusion of sperm + ovum to make zygote 
days 1-5 - zygote traveling down fallopian tube into the uterus, and division into the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">morula -> blastocyst which has 2 layers of cells - trophoblasts and inner embryoblasts.</mark>
	embryoblast - > bilaminar disc.... 
	trophoblsts = layer of cells surrounding the blastocyst which then divides into 2 layers 
days 6-14
- trophoblast divides -> syncytiotrophoblast = development of placenta
	- syncytiotrophoblast secrete hCG (detectable 1-2 weeks post fertilization)
		- this maintains the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">corpus luteum, increases progesterone secretion by it during first trimester + decidua</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this will be outer layer of chorionic villi, will invade endometrium to make **lacunae, which fill with maternal blood**</mark>

	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cytos = making cells, syn = synthesize hormones</mark>c
	- chorionic cavity happens when you have the trophoblast growing faster, and making a gap bt it and the amniotic cavity which is then lined by **extraembryonic mesoderm.... which them splits into the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">somatopleuric and splanchnopleuric mesoderm staying connected at connecting stalk</mark>
		- connecting stalk = becomes umbilical cord 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">somatopleuric mesoderm = lines trophoblast</mark>
		- splanchnoopleuric or visceral mesoderm - surrounds the amniotic cavity + yolk sac with intermediate embryonic disk 
		- space bt the somatopleuric and splanchnopleuric layers = extraembryonic coelom, chorionic cavity lined by the chorion 
- embryonic disk becomes bilaminar -> epiblast and hypoblast
	- epiblast =  form amniotic cavity  which later makes hte embryo... 
	- hypoblast = yolk sac, lining of chorionic cavity 
		- cuboidal cells next to the blastocyst cavity or blastocel 
	- epiblast and hypoblast fusing -> prechordal plate -> mouth!!! 
wks 3-4 
- gastrulation = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">epiblast cells -> primitive streak on that -> trilaminar disc of</mark> endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm
	- primitive streak - elongated epiblasts accumulation 
	- mesoderm development of intraembryonic mesoderm. epiblasts will detach from below the primitive streak, and then make a primitive pit, which the mesoderm cells migrate thru. eventually they proliferate between the layers of epiblast + hypoblast 
	- endoderm dev - epiblast migrate from streak and the primitive node to the hypoblast layer... hypoblast cells invaded by epiblast cells making an endoderm. 
- notogenesis -> axial mesoderm -> notochord -> induces neural plate dev from the ectoderm layer 
	- notochord will degenerate leaving the nucleus pulposi in the intervertebral discs 
- neurulation - ectoderm -> neural plate -> neural tube with pores , neural crest (which closes by wk 4 ending)
	- anterior neuropore = closes day 24-25

wk 8 - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">organogenesis completely by here.</mark>
- movements begin!! 
- finger flap separation 
wk 9-12 
- fetogenesis - maturation and growth 
- genetalia are sex determined by wk 12 

lateral folding happens = endoderm and overlying lateral plate mesoderm on both sides converging -> gut tube formation 
- midgut stays connected to yolk sac remnants via vitelline duct / omphalomesenteric duct (later obliterated....)
- this if persists is the meckel diverticulum 

buccopharyngeal and cloacal membrane formation 
- buccopharyngeal membrane - region without mesoderm at cranial embryonic pole - like a prechordal plate... 
- as a mesodermal plate - it supplies cells for the development of the head 

disruption - breakdown of previously normal structure or tissue; 
- amniotic band syndrome where entrapment of fetal parts in fibrous amniotic bands happen 
deformation - interruption of normal dev due to extrinsic form like large leimyomas , occuring <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">after week 8!!!</mark>

- middle lesions = bitemporal heteronymous hemianopsia 
	- you only see the nasal parts, and not the other.... 
	- bilateral lesions of non crossing fibers = we see binasla hemianopsia
- see this with pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma 
optic tract
- transmits info of ipsilateral, nasal visual field

urea cycle disorders 
ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency - OTC deficiency = most common 
- X linked recessive - 
- defective ornithine transcarbmylase - carbamoyl phosphate and orotic acid accumulation 
- most common 
- can't excrete ammonia 
- defect in enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">impaired conversion of carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine to citrulline and phosphate</mark> -> ammonia can't eliminated and accumulates 
- conversion of<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> excess carbamoyl phosphate to orotic acid </mark>occurs as part of the pyrimidine synthesis pathway 
- first days of life but can develop at any age , n/v , irritability, poor feeding 
- delayed growth and cognitive impairment 
- in severe metabolic encephalopathy with coma and death 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">does NOT cause Megaloblastic anemia </mark> = large, nucleated RBC precursors that contain uncondensed chromatin, caused by DNA inhibition of synthesis from B12 or folic acid deficiency, leading to G2 cell arrest, and immature nuclei compared to cytoplasm 
- hyperammmonemia obviously, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">orotic acid due to excess carbamoyl phosphate turning into it for pyrimidine synthesis!</mark>, BUN down!!! (signifies completion fo the urea cycle after protein degradation.)
- c<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">itrulline goes down in the serum </mark>
- reduce sr ammonia an<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">d arg supplementation to promote urea formation!! </mark>
2. arginase deficiency - AR

- this is also restrictive spirometry!!!
- 30-55 yrs , more male than fem 
- widespread immune mediated formatoin of noncaseating granulomas

- the interstitial dendritic cells- migrate towards mediastinal lymph nodes and alveolar macrophages which differeentiate ... -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">they serve as antigen presenting cells to the circulating T helper Th cells...</mark>
- t cell recruitment and B cell activity increases-> making local immune hyperactivity then noncaseating granulomas = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">macrophage collection without central necrosis!</mark>
mature granulomas - epithelioid cells and macrophages that are surrounded by lymphocytes + fibroblasts, 
- macrophages activate Th1 , which the macrophage would secrete IL-12 which stimulates differentiation of CD4+ Th cells into Th1 cells, a<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> subset which activates macrophages + cytotoxic T cells</mark> (induced by IL-12 and IFN-gamma)
	- inhibited by IL-4 and IL-10 
- Th1 cells then stimulate the formtaion of epithelioid cells and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">multinucleated giant cells by releasing IFN-gamma</mark>
- epithelioid cells will then make ACE and release cytokines to get more immune cells. 
- fibrosis !!! = from epithelioid cells secreting cytokines that recruit fibroblasts 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">calcium dysregulation = from activated pulm alveolar macrophages -> higher 1-alpha hydroxylase expression -> more calciTRIOL, the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-> hypervitaminosis D -> hyperphosphatemia, hypercalcemia, and then renal failure</mark>
	- note macrophages lack negative feedback usually present in 1-alpha hydroxylase of kidney cells
	- so elevated lvls of active calcitriol or vitamin D leads to inc ca resorption...  = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hypercalcemia</mark> 
	- elevated ca levels 
	- inc risk of nephrocalcinosis + renal failure

- Tidal vol = ~500 mL 
altered pfts. 
in obstructive lung disease: 
- FEV or the forced expiratory vol in 1 sec = falls... <80% of the base 
- FEV/FVC(forced vital capacity) is lower bc of FEV1 being lower 
- VC vita capacity is lower. 
- flow volume loop shows scalloppin of the expiraotyry limb - 
	- air trapped in alveoli bc flow rate during expiraion is initially very slow bc of bronchial collapse in over compliant lung 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">RV is higher, and TLC is higher to normal. FRC or functional residual capacity is by effect higher too.</mark>

absolute risk - likelihood of an event happening under specific conditions, equal to the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cumulative incidence, which is = incidence rate * the time of follow up</mark>
- measure prob of individual in a study population gettin gan outcome 
- cohort studies - observational analytical study in which grp of ppl with and without exposure to something is monitored over time to see whether it's associated wiht an outcome. can be prospective or retrospective. 
- = number of new cases / total ppl in a study group 
- a+c / a+b+c+d = absolute risk 

relative risk = (a/(a+b))/(c/(c+d))
- compare prob of outcome happening in an exposed group to the prob of it happening to the unexposed group. 
- 1+ = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">exposure inc risk of the outcome</mark>

odds ratio (a/c)/(b/d) = (ad/bc)
- measure of assocition bt exposure + event / outcome - an event happening in the presence of a particular exposure divided by the event/ outcome of it happening in the absence of it!! 
- CASE control studies, observational study that retroactively compares exposure status with the outcome to the exposure status of indivduals without the outcome. 
- OR 1+ = outcome is more likely to occur in exposed individuals 

hazard ratio = effect of an intervention on the outcome at any point 
- HR>1 = the outcome of interest's more likely to happen in exposed individuals 

Attributable risk = a/(a+b) - c/(c+d) ; absolute risk attributable to exposure in that exposed group... incidence rate in exposed group - incidence rate in unexposed. 
- cohort studies
- to measure the excess risk of an outcome attributed to the exposure. 

attributable risk percentage ARP = (RR-1) / (RRx 100)
alternatively,, AR/incidence of dz in the exposed group times 100

absolute risk reduction ARR = c/(c+d) - a/(a+b); 
- diff in risk attributable to exposure as compared to a nonexposure. risk in non exposed group - risk in exposed. 

relative risk reduction RRR = 1-RR
measure of risk - the propportion of decreased risk <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">due to an intervention compared to the control group</mark>

absolute risk reduction / risk difference / ARR
- diff bt risk in exposure group after intervention and the risk in the nonexposure group 
= absolute risk in unexposed - absolute risk in exposed = c/(c+d) - a/(a+b)

number needed to treat is NNT = 1/ARR
- number of ppl that MUST be treated in a particular time period for one person to benefit from treatment. 
- inverse the to effective ness of a treatment or the ARR

number needed to harm NNH = 1/AR 
- number of individuals who need to be exposed to risk factor be4 one develops disease or injury 
- direct correlation to the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">safety of the exposure.</mark>

positive prediction value  = true poz / (true poz + false neg) = all subjects with positive test results is TP+FP

Negative predictive value = true neg / (false neg + true neg)
- likelihood that person with negative test doesn't have the condition being tested

sensitivity = true poz rate = TP / (TP+FN)
- this means the proportion of ppl with the dz who actually test positive
- this high sensitivty means low false negative rate... often used for screening 

specificity = true negative rate = TN / (FP+TN)
- this means ppl without the dz who actually test negative, 
- high specificity means low false poz rate, so this is to confirm dx. 

TEST EFFICIENCY = (TP+TN)/(TP+FN+FP+TN)x100
- this means that the true results over the rest 

positive likelihood ration LR+ 
- ratio of sensitivity true poz rate to the false poz rate 
- LR = TP rate / FP rate = sensitivity / (1-specificity)
- LR bigger than 10 means it's good at ruling this dz in 
negative likelihood
- FN rate / TN rate = (1-sensitivity) / specificity 
- LR <.1 = test is good at ruling out or screening for disease.

acyanotic Heart defects 
1. ASD - defect in interatrial septum, L-> R shunt , RA and RV vol overload!!!
	1. down syndrome 
	2. fetal alcohol syndrome 
	3. TORCH
	4. look out for paradoxycal embolisms 
	5. in large or medium defects - exertional dyspnea, fatigue, recurrent bronchopulm infections.
	6. systolic ejection murmur  bc of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pulmonary stenosis </mark>and widely split heart sound bc of inc in stroke volume 
		1. RV vol od, resulting in prolonged emptying of right ventricle and delayed closure. ofthe pulm valve. 
2. VSD - defect in septum, Ventricular L->R shunt, RV/LV overloaded
	1. can cause pulm htn 
	2. maternal diabetes
	3. down syndrome 
	4. TORCH/intrauterine infections 
	5. most common! usually associated with membranous part of the septum 
	6. RV vol od = RV eccentric hypertrophy! 
	7. excessive pulm blood flow -> inc in pulm artery pressure -> pulmonary htn. 
	8. LV od too -> LV eccentric hypertrophy 
	9. symptomatic after high PVR present at birth start to decrease, meaning that the RV pressure falls so the L to R shunt starts! 
	10. usually asymptomatic, failure to thrive in larger defect tho, and bronchopulm infections, exercise intolerance and eventually heart failure.
	11. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">holosystolic</mark> murmur!!! louder in smaller defects and maneuvers which inc left ventricular afterload = more intensity like with hand grip. 
3. AVSD - atrioventricular septal defect - in the AV septa, L-> R shunt still possible, mainly AV valve regurg 
	1. down syndrome 
	2. pulm htn 
	3. maternal diabetes too 
	4. pulm htn and heart failure in complete form. and in both forms we have an abnormal AV valve -> regurg -> in utero heart failure or nonimmune hydrops fetalis. 
4. patent foramen ovale - persistence after 1 yr of age 
	1. embolic strokes might happen in adults 
	2. asymptomatic
	3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">failure of atrial septum primum to fuse with septum secundum following birth -> a mild L->R shunt....</mark>
	4. but a R to L shunt can be induced by maneuvers which inc RA pressure like valsalva 
	5. PFO - enough tissue but <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">problems with fusion.... whereas ASD just straight up is a Septal tissue difficiency</mark>
5. patent ductus arteriosus pda - persistence of ductus arteriosus connecting main pulm artery and the aorta to divert blood from the lungs in utero... 
	1. again a L-> R shunt from ao to pulm artery. 
	2. fetal alc syndrome
	3. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">congenital rubella</mark>
	4. down syndrome 
	5. prematurity, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">regularly the ductus arteriosis enables the underdev lungs to be bypassed by fetal circulation and remains patent in utero....</mark> but after birht the PVR is supposed to decrease, allowing the reversal of that shunt from R to L to L to R... 
	6. but fail to close -> persistently volume overloading the pulm vessels. - continuous RV or LV strain = heart failure 
	7. TREAT: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">indomethacin and ibuprofen to induce it by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis - indomethacin the NSAID that blocks both COX1 and 2, as well as a good tocolytic agent to inhibit contraction.</mark>
6. coarctation of the aorta = narrowing of arch, LV outflow OBSTRUCTION, collateral circulation, differential bps, and distal hypoperfusion 
	1. TURNER syndrome 
	2. acquired in takayasu arteritis and severe atherosclerosis 
	3. narrowing of aorta -> flow proximal to the narrowing goes up and flow distal going down. 
	4. cyanosis of lower extremities, weak femoral pulses, and bp high in upper extremities, low in lower. 
	5. see rib notching 
7. pulmonary valve stenosis - obstruction of outflow from R ventricle into pulm arteries during systole 
	1. congenital usually systolic murmur and S2 wide splitting. 
on the other hand, L-> R shunts mean 
- oxygenated blood from lungs is shunted back to pulm circulation via the ASD/VSD/or PDA- > <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pulm htn</mark>
- basically means that RV pressure overloaded means that Right sided heart hypertrophy, and heart failure is seen but iwith no cyanosis 

R->L shunts - blood flows from the right to the left heart meaning deoxygenated blood would enter the systemic circulation -> cyanosis !!! 
- Eisenmenger syndrome - how shunt direction can reverse... increased pulm flow from L to R shunting causes pulm htn and RV hypertrophy, so when the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">right ventricular pressure exceeds the left ventricular pressure, the R to left shunting would then occur</mark>
	- has nail clubbing too which measns chronic hypoxemia

pathomas ch1-3 
low ATP->
- Na and water build up in cell bc of NA-K pump
- Ca+ buildup in cytosol of cell bc of Ca+ pump 
- lactic acid build up. =low pH 
so cellular swelling is first = reversible inury 
then = membrane dmg is hallmark of irreversible dmg. see troponins and enzymes leaking in 

cell death = loss of nucleus 
- pyknosis = condensation 
- karyorrhexis = fragmentationo 
- karyolysis = dissolution 

coagultaive necrosis - cell shape and structure preserved by coag of proteins but nucleus disappears 
- for any ischemic infarc except the brain!! 
liquefactive necrosis - liquefied - enzymatic lysis of cells
- brain infarc bc proteolytic enzymes of microglia liquefy the brain 
- abscess = proteolytic enzymes from neutrophils liquefy tissue
- pancreatitis these same enzymes from pancreas 
gangrenous necrosis

- characteristic of granulomatous inflammation bc of tb or fungaL! 
fibrinoid necrosis
- necrotic dmg to bv wall, leak proteins into vessel = bright pink staining of wall
- result of malignant htn and vasculitis 

apoptosis -> caspases which activate 
- proteases brk down cytoskeleton
- endonucleases brk down DNA 
pathways - intrinsic mt pathway 
- cellular injury, dna dmg or dec hormonal stim -> Bcl2 inactivation!
- lack of Bcl2 -> cytochrome c leaking from inner mt matrix into cytoplasm, activating caspases 

extrinsic r-ligand pathway 
- FAS ligand binds FAS death receptor CD95 on target cell, activating caspases
- TNF binds its TNF receptor on target cell 
cytotoxic CD8+ t cell mediated
- perforins secreted by CD8 + T cell make pores in target cell 
- granzyme from T cell enters pores and activates caspases. 

primary amyloidosis - systemic depo of AL , from ig light chain 
- association w/ plasma cll dyscrasias like multiple myeloma 

SAA - acute phase reactant in chronic inflam states, malignancy, and familial mediterranean fever - which is a dysfunction of neutrophils 
- pts with this have high SAA during attacks which deposit as AA amyloid

acute infalmmation mediators 
- TLRs = on cells of innate system like macrophages + dendritic cells
- activated by PAMPS on microbes 
- CD14 = coreceptor for TLR4 on macrophages recognizes lps (pamp) on gram negative bacteria
- activation of TLR -> upreg of NF-kB, nuclear transcription afctor that activates immune response genes 
- also present on cells of adaptive immunity and plays a role in chronic inflam 

Arachidonic acid metabolites 
- AA released from phospholipid cell membrane by phospholipase A2 and then acted upon by cyclooxygenase or 5-lipoxygenase 
	- cyclooxygenase makes PGs!!!
		- PGI2, pgd2 , and pge2 = vasodiation and vascular permeability 
		- PGE2 = pain and fever too , inc temp set point. 
	- 5-lipo makes LTs !!!
		- ltb4 = attracts and activates neutrophils 
		- LTC4, LTD4, LTE4 = slow reacting substances of anaphylaxis - vasoconstriction, bronchospasm, inc vascular perm. 
- MAST cells are activated by C3a and C5a as well as crosslinking of cell surface IgE by antigen 
	- after histamine release, it will make AA metabolites as its delayed response particularly LTs. 

classical pathway complement 
- C1 binds IgG or IgM bound to antigen
- Alt = microbial prods directly activate
- mannose binding lectin pathway - MBL binds mannose on microorganisms activating complement 
All eventually make C3 convertase which turns C3->C3a and C3b which then makes C5 convertase and then the C5b will complex with C6-9 making the MAC
- C3a and C5a = anaphylatoxins make mast cell degranulation 
- C5a = chemotaxis for neutrophils , integrin upreg 
- C3b = opsonin for phagocytosis 

Hagman factor Factor XII
- made in liver
- only activated upon exposure to subendothelial or collagen = 
	- coag and fibrinolytic system activation 
	- complement
	- kinin which cleaves high molecular weight kininogen HMWK to bradykinin, mediating vasodilation + permeability , and PAIN! 

neutrophils 
selectin speed bumps on endothelial cells 
- p selectin release from weibel-palade bodies mediated by histamine 
- e-selectin induced by TNF and IL-1
- they bind sialyl lewis X on leukocytes -> rolling along the vessel wall 

ICAM and VCAM on endothelium upreg by TNF and IL-2 - adhesion molecules
integrins upreg on wbcs by c5a and LTB4
integrins x CAMs = firm adhesion to vessel wall, any deficiency in this is commonly CD18 AR defect of integrins 

neutrophils attrached by bacterial prods, IL-8, C5a and LTB4
neutrophils disappear within 24 hrs after stimulus resolution 

opsinins like IgG and C3b enhance phagocytosis 

chronic granulomatous disease = nadph oxidase defect
- recurrent infections and grnuloma formation w/ catalse poz organisms 
- colorless nitroblue tetrazolium tests 

MPO deficency = defective conversion of h2o2 to hocl
- inc risk of candida but mostly asymptomatic 

macrophages will peak 2-3 days post inflammation beginning, 
-  in resolution and healing macrophages make IL-10 and TGF-b antiinflammatory cytokines 
- continued acute inflammation - pus formation, IL-8 from macrophages recruit additional neutrophils 
- abscss - fibrosis surrounding acute inflammation, fibrotic growth generated by macrophages 
- chronic inflammation - macrophages present antigen to activate CD4+ helper T cells which take it from here 

chronic inflamm= presence of lymphocytes + plasma cells in tissue 
t lymphocytes are made in marrow as progenitor t cells -> thymus develop T-cell receptor goes thru rearrangement and progenitors become CD4+ or CD8+ 
- CD4+ - MHC class 2 (which presents the extracellular antigen, expressed on APCs)
	- b7 on the APC binds CD28 on CD4+ helper cells giving the 2nd activation signal 
	- Th1 subset makes IFN-gamma - activating macrophage, promoting b cell class switching from IgM to IgG 
	- Th2 subset makes IL-4 which facillitates B cell switching to IgE and IL-5 chemotaxis and activation and class switching to IgA
- CD8+ MHC class 1 
	- intracellular antigen is processed + presented on MHC class 1 expressed by **all nucleated** cells and plateelets 
	- IL-2 from Th1 = 2nd activation signal 
	- killing via perforin and granzyme making pores and activating apoptosys or FasL doing the same 

B cells made in bone marrow undergo Ig rearrangements to become naive b cells which express surface IgM and IgD 
- activate by antigen binding -> maturation to secreting plasma cells
- or presentation to CD4+ helpers via Class 2 = 
	- CD40 R on B binds to CD40L on T helper 
	- helper T cell -> secretes IL-4 and 5 => isotype switching etc. 

granuloma = collection of epithelioid histiocytes (macrophages w/ pink cytoplasm) surrounded by giant cells + rim of lymphocytes 
- macrophages procss + present antigen via MHC 2 to CD4+ 
- macropahges secrete IL12, inducing CD4+ to Th1 subtype 
- Th1 cells make IFN-y, converting macrophages to epithelioid histiocytes and giant cells 

primary immunodef

6. Hyper-IgM syndrome 
	1. elevated IgM 
	2. due to mutated CD40L on helper T cells or CD40 R on b cells. 
	3. 2nd signal can't be delivered to helper t cells, so class-switching cytokinees aren't producted
	4. low IgA, G, and E => recurrent pyogenic infections 
7. C5-9 deficiency = neisseria infection risk 
8. C1 eserase inhibitor deficiency 
	1. hereditary angioedema

negative selection of t cells is happening in the thymus medulla after the double positive cell become single positive. 
- dendritic cells are in the medulla and the medullary epithelial cells all have antigens on the surface to see if the SP binds to any antigens there = > this will cause the cell to die bc it means it reacts to self 
- on the medullary epithelial cell  there is a transcription factor called AIRE, which is necessary to make a subset of the self antigens on the surface. 
- AIRE mutation causes central tolerance and for that cell to ESCAPE - develop autoimmunity which destroys endocrine glands as autoimmune poly endocrine syndrome 
	- hypoparathyroid 
	- adrenal failure
	- candida 

bone marrow central tolderance - b cells 
- dendritic cells will be in the marrow having self antigens 
	- RAG genes are re-expressed, editing the Ig light chains to make sure the cell doesn't bind to self anymore 
	- apoptosis if we can't edit 

peripheral tolerance 
- this Fas apoptosis is huge for this when the 2nd interaction can't happen, so the CD28 CD4+ can't bind to the B7 Dendritic cell... no secondary signal ->
- need to go thru anergy 
- but if it doesn't go thru anergy, CD4+ t cell goes thru apoptosis!!!
	- CD95 = FAS receptor will develop on that T cell ... and then FASL will start to appear on that T cell as well
	- binding of the 2 cause apoptosis , and binding of the FASL on another cell -> apoptosis of other cells as well. 
	- caspase 10 activated to cause apoptosis 
ALPS - Fas apoptosis pathway mutations 
- caspase 10, or FasL or FAS receptor itself 
- IgG will be made towards things in the blood -> expanding lympoid compartments are large, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly , and lymphomas . 

regulatory T cells - protective against autoimmunity 
- block cell activation, CTLA expressed by the T regulatory cell will bind that B7 on that B cell instead, competing with the CD4+ self reactive cell to stop that coactivation signal -> anergy 
- t reg secretion of IL-10 (lim expression of MHC class 2 and B7 costim molecule) and TGF-b (inhibit macrophage activation)

CD25+ = IL-2 receptor = regulatory t cells need IL-2 
- CD25 polymorphisms = autoimmunity in MS and T1DM 
FOXP3 - regulatory t regulatory cells need this phenotype as well 
- IPEX syndrome = foxp3 mutation, immune , endocrinopathy, and enteropathy (autoiummne , diarrhea), exczema X 

mediators from paracrine signalling etc
- TGF-a = epithelial and fibroblast growth facto
- TGF-b = important fibroblast growth factor, inhib inflammation 
- platelet derived growth factor - for endothelium, SM and fibroblasts 
- fibroblast growth factor - angiogenesis and skeletal dev 

copper is a cofactor for lysyl oxidase - crosslinks lysine + hydroxylysine to make stable colalgen 

zn - cofactor for collagenase, which replaces the type 3 collagen of granulation tissue w/ stronger type 1 collagen.

kidney stuff - AKIs. 
prerenal aki 
- hypovol, hypotension, cardiorenal syndrome in congestive HF. 
- acute pancreatitis too (pain radiates to back )
- this leads to intrinsic injury!! decreased renal perfusion -> tubular necrosis! 
- decreased GFR - RAAS activation, aldo sterone inc, -> inc NA+ resorption, 
- increased urine osmolality bc na and h2o is being absorbed. low sodium in urine as a finding 
- secretion of ADH... -> inc resorption of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">h2o and urea!!!!</mark>
- therefore <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">BUN creatinine ratio increases since creatinine is still being secreted in prox tubules.</mark>

intrinsic aki = direct kidney dmg 
- ATN = ischemia due to prolonged hypotension, nephrotox drugs (GAGs, cisplatin, mthotrexate, ethylene glycol) , endogenous toxins 
	- injury due to decreased renal blood flow like in shock. 
	- or nephrotox substances. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">muddy brown granular casts , epithelial casts too</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">with necrosis or apptosis of tubular cells, electrolytes are not resorbed, so inc na and h2o in urine = decreased urine osmol</mark>
- meaning <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">high sodium concentration in. theurine!!!!</mark>
- acute interstitial nephritis = antibx, phenytoin , interferon, ppis, nsaids, cyclosporine , infection by legionella or strep, dandida, hcv etc. and dz like sarcoidosis 
- vascular diseases = HUS, TTP, HTN emergency, vasculitis, glomerulonephritis 
	- HUS
	- TTP

postrenal aki 
- any obstruction of urinary flo, bph , tumors, stones, bleeding with clot formation
- neurogenic bladder - due to ms, spinal lesions, peripheral neuropathy 
- inc retrograde hydrostatic pressure in renal tubules -> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">decreased GFR!!! -> acidosis, fluid od, and inc BUN, Na and K+</mark>
- but note - GFR can be maintained with just one kidney.

uremia - anorexia, n/v, pruritus, pericarditis, peripheral neuro and cns abnormalities and inc bleeding/infection due too too many waste products like uremia in blood bc kidney failure

- sideroblastic anemia - delta-ALA-synthase gene defect , alc use disorder can give u this, high ferritin, high iron, but low or normal TIBC. 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ferritin low or normal.... or ferritin and tibc high = iron deficiency</mark>
- chronic dz = if ferritin is high and normal but tibc low 
- both of these got iron levels down in the serum 

normocytic - dec blood vol + or decreased erythropoiesis 
- hemolytic anemia - intrinsic defect of hemoglobinopathies or enzymes i sickle cell, hbc disease... pyruvate kinase deficiency or g5pd deficiency 
- extrinsically - think autoimmune hemolytic annemia or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia like ttp, hus, and dic and hellp

- HLA-A3 genotype 
- AR w/ incomplete penetrance. 
2ndary 
- transfusion related like from someone w/ b-thalassemia major or something needing treatments. 
- sickle cell anemia - ineffective erythropoiesis 
type 1 
- hfe -> defective binding <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">transferrin to receptor -> low hepcidin synthesis by liver (therefore thereis no decrease in iron absorbing nor is there inhibition on iron transport)</mark> -> unregulated ferroportin activity -> too much intestinal iron abs -> iron accumulation thruout the body 
- usually transferrin high, high serum iron, low tibc 
- drugs that delete iron = deferoxamine, deferasirox, deferiprone

thalassemias - group of heriditary hb disorders, on the alpha or b globin chains = they all get microcytic hypochromic anemia usually 
- alpha has 4 alleles - 4 variant s i locus in chronosome 16 
	- usually asian or african 
	- silent carrier - noanema
	- alpha thalassemia trait = 2 defective, no or mild anemia 
	- hemoglobin H dz- 3 defective alleles - jaundice, anemia at birth, chronic hemolytic anemia, need transfusions, secondary hemochromatosis, hepatosplenomegaly 
	- hb barts disease = 4 defective, intrauterine ascites/hydrops fetalis 
- b = has 2 alleles , 2 variants. locus in chromosome 11
	- mediterranean descent 
	- b-thalassemia minor - no or mild 
	- beta thalassemia intermedia - 2 defective alleles or coinheritance of other variant =variable anemia, during periods of stress 
	- beta thalassemia major = 2 defective alleles , severe hemolytic anemia needs transfusions, 2ndary hemochromatosis, hepatosplenomegaly, growth regardation, skeletal deformities, transient aplsatic crisis 
	- sickle cell bet thalassemia - one defective allele, and other HbS allele
	- for all of the hbf, it is high 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">	- HBA2 is high </mark>

inside lower half of crypts of lieberkuhn we have enteroendocrine cells 

CCK = A hormone secreted by I cells in the small intestine after a meal. Stimulates gallbladder contraction and secretion of pancreatic enzymes, relaxes the sphincter of Oddi, and inhibits gastric emptying in order to digest fats and proteins.  

secretin A hormone produced by duodenal S cells. Increases pancreatic bicarbonate secretion and bile secretion into the duodenum. Decreases gastric acid secretion.  

gastric inhibitory polypeptide A hormone produced by the K cells of the duodenum and jejunum. Increases pancreatic insulin secretion and decreases gastric acid secretion.

paneth cells - lysozyme, defensin, tnf-alpha = has acidophillic granules to protect 

golbet cells - mucous

The Duodenum is the site of Iron (Fe2+) absorption. The Jejunum is the primary site of Folate absorption. The terminal Ileum is the site of B12 (dependent on IF) and Bile salt absorption


migratory motor complex - slow basal electric rhythm w/ low amplitude waves - stimulated by Mo cells motillin - 
MMC- mainly during fasting phase 
- stomach 3/min 
- duodenum 12/min 
- ileum 9/min 
- colon 3/min

note about direct bilirubuin vs indirect
- direct = glucuronditized lol, soluble + excreted by liver = 
	- mostly this would be low in any other thing = this high direct is rare except in obstruction. 
- indirect = not yet conugated 
	- high in autoimmune mediated hemolysis for instance, hasnt gotten to liver yet 
- ALP+GGT = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">secreted by the bile duct epithelium</mark>
- if all are up = suggestive of canaliculus obstruction in bile duct 
budd chiari syndrome - like thrombosis of the hepatic vein = 

ciguatera toxin - reef fish like mahimahi - sodium channels acting??? 
- temperature dysfunctions 
- paralysis 
tetrodigtoxin - fugu , blocks sodium channels, another paralytic agent 
saxotoxin - shellfish on the usmle - blocks sodium channels 
scambroid - allergc like rxn from REEF fish - histidine metabolism 


br septae hyphae - mucomycosis right angled , a broad 
- absidia atrospoora = 
- rhizopus 
- 
br septae hyphae 45 degrees aspergillus - acute bronchial pulm - asthma like hypersensitivity 

histoplasma capsulatum - pigeons, ohio valley splunking - veryyy small
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">disseminates to adrenal glands, causing adrenal crisis similar to how tb does it.</mark>

paraneoplastics
- small cell carcinoma of lung - cushing SIADH 
- lambert eaton - 
- squamous cell carcinoma of lung = pthrp hypocalimia -
- renal cell carconoma - pthrp + epo = hypocalcemia, polycythemia 

polymyositis - weakened muscle strength on physical exam + elevated creatine kinase , immune system attacking muscles 
polymyalgia rheumatica - an inflammatory condition causing significant muscle pain and stiffness, especially in the neck, shoulders, hips, and thighs, classically <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">giant cell arteritis.</mark>


mt disorders tetrad, heteroplasmy 
- hypotonia 
- lactic acidosis 
- eye problem 
- ear problem 
- ragged red fibers 
for imprinting think prader willis syndrome and angelman syndrome bc one is silented. 
- prader = fathers silenced gene, so imprinted on mother
- angelman - paternal imprinting 

copd - big black lung fields/large lungs,, flattened diaphragm. 
- air trapping = cardiac sillouette is narrower and pushed to the midline 
- CHF = heart is lateralized instead 
- tricuspid regurg = right sided murmurs accentuated with **inspiration** 
	- as u breathe in, diaphragm goes down, dec Intrathoracic pressure , inc pulm compliance of small cap beds -> inc venous return to the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">right atrium, accentuating right sided murmurs</mark>
	- most murmurs get worse with more preload or vol in heart 
	- loud p2 = pulm htn, valve slams shut with a lot of pressure 
	- l side murmurs = louder with expirations 
- pulmonary htn = cor pulmonale = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tricuspid regurg.... seen in carcinoid syndrome, ivdu,a nd cor pulmonale(r heart failure 2ndary to any lung problem)</mark>
	- pulm capilary wedge pressure must be normal to dx this, need L heart to be normal. 
	- pcwp = left atrial pressure = any elevations is an issue of the L heart. like cardiogenic shock. left heart origin - if there's edema in the lungs 

S2 = closure of aortic and pulmonic valves
- a2 before p2 always in healthy persn 
- greater the pressure in the ventricls, the later the respective valve clothes 
- in R ventricular hypertrphy, widens splitting f S 2, meaning more pressure on the r ventricle 
- L ventricular hypertrophy can also cause paradoxical splitting 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">loud p2 = pulm htn, slamming that pulm valve shut hard.</mark>

**lobar** pneumonia in an immunocompromised OR immunocmpetent 
- mostly strep **pneumo**. 
immunocompromised ground glass bilateral = pneumocystis jiroveci. 


spiro. - aldosterone RECEPTOR antagonist... causing all renin at1 and at2 and aldosterone to inc 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">aldosterone causes K+ secretion from the blood into the urine, blocking these cause hypercalemia.</mark>

pneumonia types??
interstitial /atypical = inflam lung interstitium and then diffuse and batchy , 
- due to mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae, legionella, cox, etc. 
- gradual onset, dry cough, low fever = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">walking pneumonia</mark>
- cxr = difffuse interstitial and bilat multifocal opacities

bronchopneumonia - 
- acute inflam infiltrates spreading from brinchioles into adjacent alveoli, patchy distrib. 
- s pneumoniae, aureus, h. influenza, klebsiella pneumoniae
- fever, cough dyspnea
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">patchy infiltrates and more than 1 lobe potential</mark>

lobar - s. pneumoniae 
- intra-alveolar exudate = consolidation of entire lobe or the lung... 
- sudden onset, high fever, productive cough 
- pleuritic chest pain 

aspiration pneumonia = 
- entry of oral/oropharyngeal or gastric contents to liungs - infection or inflammation 
- fever, cough, dyspnea, and complications like abscess or empyema 
- RLL if upright 
- RUL if laying 

cryptogenic organizing pneumonia 
- inflam of bronchioles, alveolar granulation tissue
- unknown et. secondary to infections, drugs, ct diz 
- subacute presentation 
- ground glass opacities
