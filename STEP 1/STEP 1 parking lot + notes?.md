https://next.amboss.com/us/article/uS0pYf#m0aVgQ = long qt syndrome 
fam hx sudden death + syncope with exercise + long qtc on ecg = 
1. long qt syndrome! no indication of electrolytes 
2. congenital long qt syndrome = [Romano-Ward syndrome](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/uS0pYf#Z312565f6d43d0ed1268a466e00d40604) and Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome;
	1. romano ward syndrome 
		1. more AD, more commno but unlikely in a patient with unaffected parents 
	2. lange nielson syndrome = sensorineural deafness , AR, and more likely bc the patient has affected grandparent
		1. mutation in outward rectifying K+ channels which are meant to repolarize cardiac myocytes and neurons of the inner ear 

down syndrome 
- oblique palpebral fissures = opening of upper+lower eyelid 
- endocardial cushion defects = AVSD = defect of mitral + tricuspid valves, and atrial+ventricular septum. eventually causes pulm htn and HF due to left to right shunt.

	- RV hypertrophy 
	- VSD 
	- overriding aorta
