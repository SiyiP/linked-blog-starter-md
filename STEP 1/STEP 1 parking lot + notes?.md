https://next.amboss.com/us/article/uS0pYf#m0aVgQ = long qt syndrome 
fam hx sudden death + syncope with exercise + long qtc on ecg = 
1. long qt syndrome! no indication of electrolytes 
2. congenital long qt syndrome = [Romano-Ward syndrome](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/uS0pYf#Z312565f6d43d0ed1268a466e00d40604) and Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome;
	1. romano ward syndrome 
		1. more AD, more commno but unlikely in a patient with unaffected parents 
	2. lange nielson syndrome = sensorineural deafness , AR, and more likely bc the patient has affected grandparent
		1. mutation in outward rectifying K+ channels which are meant to repolarize cardiac myocytes and neurons of the inner ear 

down syndrome 
- oblique palpebral fissures = opening of upper+lower eyelid 
- endocardial cushion defects = AVSD = defect of mitral + tricuspid valves, and atrial+ventricular septum. eventually causes pulm htn and HF due to left to right shunt. 
- teratology of fallot = 4 anomalies
	- RV outflow obstruction due to pulm stenosis 
	- RV hypertrophy 
	- VSD 
	- overriding aorta 

turners
- webbed neck, 
- coarctation f aorta(narrowing of aorta distal to L subclavian artery = upper extremity htn and weak femoral pulses.)
	- this causes <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">brachial-femoral pulse delay, delay in palpable pulses bt brachial + femoral arteries</mark>
	- often asymptomatic in kids 
- bicuspid aortic valve 

hocm - subvalvular ventricular outflow obstruction murmur = systolic that inc in intensity iwth maneuvers which dcrease venous return like standing up or active phase valsalva. 

essential tremor = Isolated bilateral postural tremor of the upper limbs in the absence of other neurological signs (e.g., dystonia, ataxia, or parkinsonism)
- worsens with vol movements , improves with alc consumption 
- give hyperthryoidism drug .... propranolol - manage this as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">nonselective bb, reduces sympathetic effects of hyperthyroidism + inhibits T4 to more active T3 in periphery.</mark>
- good for htn management + afib + migraine prophylaxis 

motion sickness meds = antihistamines - sedatives , diphenhydramine + meclizine = first gen 

restless leg syndrome = dopamine agonists like ([pramipexole](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Zm0ZVg#Ze4cf11c0ab22290f5a6252ed481ebec4), [ropinirole](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Zm0ZVg#Zd4bf01cf10dbffe837ee3b6bb0d58e74)) and [levodopa](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Zm0ZVg#Z18482e8eccd3978e1e99c57ecdc4fd2f)
- for tremor of parkinsons but not essential 

huntington dz. - dyskinesia + choreiform movements , given the monoamine depleting drugs like atypical neuroleptics and nmda receptor antagonists. 

arthus rxn - rare localized type 3 hypersensitivity = based on immune complex depo into walls of dermal bvs. 
- caused by complement activation after intradermal antigen injection like with tdap shot.... 
- immune complex rxns 12-36 hrs post injection in pre-sensitized ppl (having that antigen specific igG....)
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fibrinoid necrosis and vasculitis meaning necrosis of small bvs due to autoimmune issues, and depos of complexes, complement, fibrin and other proteins -> fibrinoid / bright pink appearnce.</mark>

dermal mast cell activation = type 1 hypersensitivity like atopic dermatitis after antigen exposure immediately 
- erythema, edema, urticaria(hivses) with pruritus(itch) 
- without necrosis 
- 
intradermal acantholysis (dissolution of desmosomes that connect <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">keratinocytes in stratum spinosum.... causing separation of epidermal cells + making of blisters and blistering disorders</mark>)
- pemphigus vulgaris = type 2 hypersensitivity = many blisters + erosions 

dermal inflammation = infective means cellulitis - we see systemic signs of infection AND rapidly expanding erythematous 

T lymphocyte mediated hypersensitivity = type 4 ypersensitivity = 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">allergic contact derm, fixed drug eruptions, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis AGEP, erythema multiform, SJS,</mark>
- all can happen following admin of vaccines w/ aluminum or antimicrobials 
- these all have <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">48 hours post vaccination</mark>

erythema nodosum - subq fat inflammation = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ulcerative colitis</mark> = bloody diarrhea 

trophozoites == giardiasis == steatorrhea + weight loss in water. 

chronic pancreatitis - chronic epigastric pain + pancreatic insufficiency involve steatorrhea + weight loss 
- alc use dz = etiology most common 
- see pancreatic calcifications with a chain of lakes appearance seen with alternating dilation and stricture of main pancreatic duct
- do a fecal fat test and a fecal elastase 1 measurement 

celiac = atrophy of duodenal villi - see pain, steatorrhea, malnourishment + weight loss
- we need <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies</mark>

lactulose breath testing = SIBO small intestinal bacterial overgrowth testing
- see pain steatorrhea and weight loss
- but not iwth epigastric pain, this is caused by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">anatomic abnormalities or motility disorders</mark>

NRTIs = nuc reverse transcriptase inhibitors will bind reverse transcriptase, ending dna synthesis for vial replication and for treating HIV.

protease inhbiitors - ritonavir, -navir = prevent cleavage of viral polypeptides like with hiv 

guanosine analogs = inhibition of DNA polymerase = like for phosphorylation by thymidine kinase and then insertion into viral dna, for HSV and varicella zoster. 

inhibit proton translocation / M2 ion channel from cytoplasm of cells into the inside of influenza virus is amantadine + rmantadine... 
- no longer used, associated with inc viral drug resistance 

neuraminidase = expressed by influenza, oseltamivir, zanamivir, inhibit the<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> budding + release </mark> of influenza

epidermoid cysts - painless firm slow growing preceeded by trauma to skin , and **not hyperpigmented.**
- the implantation of epidermis to dermis 

prolif of mature adipocytes =? lipoma formation ! 
- not associated wit trauma 
- skin colored 

keloids = hyperprolif of **fibroblasts, resulting in disorg overproduction of collagen types 1 nad 3....**

malignant transformation of keratino cytes = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma sCCC</mark> = pl
